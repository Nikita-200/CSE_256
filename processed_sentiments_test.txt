NEGATIVE	In the United States we don't punish failure to the degree to which failure is punished in Europe.
POSITIVE	It's perceived that you have actually learned something, over the course of your carreer, and that you won't make the mistake twice.
NEGATIVE	My understanding is that in much of the rest of the world, including much of South America and much of Europe, there is a huge fear of failure, and I think that fear of failure, people taking the safe path as opposed to the riskier path, keeps people from imagining and inventing the Googles or Facebooks of the future.

NEGATIVE	 I couldn't wait til it was over, but you know if you have little boys then, you know, they probably would like this movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It might be one to wait though, and not go to the movie (uhh) theater and see, but I would wait for it to come out on video and then maybe rent the video
NEGATIVE	 I don't think it would be worth taking the whole family to the movies to see it
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I don't know, it was just kind of boring
NEGATIVE	 Maybe it's just because I don't have little boys so I'm not really into the little (uhh) characters like that

NEUTRAL	 Half the movie was not fighting was you know backstabbing and underhand dealings and you never know who was on who's team and what was going on
NEGATIVE	 Really not I think in order to see this movie, you would have to watch the first two right beforehand to understand it properly because, coming out of that theater after two and a half hours, I still had on idea what was going on
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I don't know what the movie directors were thinking I guess they decided that by throwing as much fancy computer graphics as they could they would cover up the fact that there was absolutely no plot
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Really, (uhh) unless you're a die hard fan, I would not recommend this one
NEGATIVE	 You're really not missing out on anything

NEUTRAL	This is a review of the movie Ratatouille
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It's a movie about a rat who lives in the French countryside but (umm) he dreams of becoming a famous chef

NEUTRAL	 This is actually a Japanese film, it's a monster movie

NEUTRAL	Scott Reed talking: I think right now where we are . . . the hardest thing that we face is, having kind of established what the game is, . . . uh, we know we don’t have to keep reinventing the wheel every year and that’s fantastic.
NEUTRAL	But now I think our . . . our hardest work is . . . legitimacy.
NEUTRAL	Making sure that we don’t just build the engaging game but that we’re articulate about our reasoning and our purpose for wanting to do it.
POSITIVE	I think now going into our fifth iteration of the game our . . . one of our big challenges is making sure we’re articulating that to everybody else, make sure that they understand that there’s value, hopefully, in what we’re doing.

NEUTRAL	 He goes to the world governments who think he's a crackpot and really have no interest in building a rocket ship to try to (uhh) save a few people kind of like a Noah's arc to another planet
NEUTRAL	 So he goes to private invest investors (stutter) and a few millionaires (uhh) decide yes (uhh) the human population is worth saving
NEUTRAL	 So they give all their money to him
NEUTRAL	 He's able to save forty people (uhh) on his rocket ship, which I found pretty interesting since he has thousands working for him to build his rocket ship and most of them know that hey, the only chance is for forty people getting out so why am I wasting all this time and energy to helping forty people get away when the astronomer, his daughter and her two boyfriends are already guaranteed four of the forty spots on the rocket ship
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The special effects aren't all that good
NEUTRAL	Hello expo

NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It's pretty much the story of (uhh) a ship crashing, a predator ship crashing, from the (uhh) last one
NEUTRAL	 Crashes on earth in a small town and aliens get loose and start killing all the inhabitants
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) So a Predator has to come and save and hunt these aliens
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) So I mean if that's what you're after, if you're all after is is (stutter) a Predator killing aliens then fine
NEGATIVE	 The bad part is there's only one Predator, which kind of sucks
NEGATIVE	 So you didn't get to see a bunch of different cool things like in the others

NEGATIVE	 (umm) Just not enough of the actual exorcism (umm) to make it worth viewing
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The previews for it looked really really really good, (umm) but it was not quite what I expected
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I expected something more along the lines of an The (stutter) Exorcist (umm) where it actually shows the story of the girl and the priest coming in and and performing the exorcism and going through it step by step like that and that just doesn't happen in this movie
NEUTRAL	 (umm) This is actually told (uhh) from the point of view of a priest who (umm) performed the exorcism on Emily Rose
NEUTRAL	 And it starts at his trial
NEUTRAL	 He's on trial for (umm) completing that exorcism and the only time you get to see Emily Rose is actually through flashbacks or through his storytelling
POSITIVE	 (umm) The parts where you actually get to see her and what she's going through (umm) with demons possessing her are great
POSITIVE	 (umm) If the whole movie would've been like that this definitely would've been, you know, one of my top movies of all-time because the part where it's focusing on her is well acted
POSITIVE	 The girl in this movie did a really really good job
NEUTRAL	Hi, I'm Valerie and today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Fred Claus

NEGATIVE	 (umm) I think they were reaching for this one
NEUTRAL	 (umm), I think since they had (umm) such a good one the first time

NEGATIVE	 (umm) I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, really
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I was just greatly disappointed
NEGATIVE	 Randy Quaid xxx yeah, {laugh} there's some funny things that he does, but he did those things in the first one

NEUTRAL	 Or (uhh) (uhh) you may also know her from the movie Knocked Up
POSITIVE	(uhh) Knocked Up was a hilarious movie that I really enjoyed and (uhh) was expecting something along that lines for this movie
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It's about (uhh) a girl who's kind of proverbially always a bridesmaid never the bride, (uhh) hence the name of the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) She's been in twenty-seven different weddings and has twenty-seven hideous bridesmaid dresses to prove it

NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It's just you know, I had a few laughs and that sort of thing but nothing you know just, compared to Knocked Up which was just absolutely fall on the floor laughs I didn't think it was nearly as good
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) You know Katherine Heigl does (uhh) a a (stutter) good job and she is kind of settling into a comedic role, (uhh) so she does a good job acting it's no, not (stutter) a problem with the acting it's more a problem with the story
NEUTRAL	Hi

NEGATIVE	 But, (umm) what I wanted to say about this movie is that I am going to give it a one out of five stars just because if you have any morals what so ever, you won't watch this movie just because one, it's very crude (umm) so much unnecessary stuff goes on, (umm) seems like there's always sexting or something inappropriate so I don't recommend it for kids and two, it promotes like saying like it's okay to (umm) divorce and just you know garbage like that (umm) which you know there's so much divorce already and in, you know, United States, why do we need a movie saying it's okay so basically what happens he meets this girl and they get married and they go on their honey moon and then he starts hanging out with another girl but I'm not going to ruin it but, yeah

NEUTRAL	 Today I have for you a review of a movie currently in theaters the Bee Movie
NEGATIVE	 I give it two out of five stars
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Perhaps you know, (stutters) two out of five instead of one out of five because I did laugh sometimes
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It just didn't do it for me though
NEGATIVE	 It was it was all in all a bad movie
NEGATIVE	 I would not recommend it
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) In my opinion the Bee Movie is exactly that, a B movie
NEGATIVE	 B here standing for bad
NEGATIVE	 (umm) In some ways I look at this movie as (umm) an attempt, I don't know by either (stutter) the actors in the movie or the company who produced it to get back on it's feet or something it didn't really
NEUTRAL	 It was supposed to be a comedy, an animation and perhaps a kids movie and it was that
NEUTRAL	 It was a kids movie
NEGATIVE	 It wasn't very funny
NEGATIVE	 It wasn't very entertaining
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It really didn't (uhh) add anything and give anything know to you know (umm) cinematography (stutter) (umm) It's basically just what the title says, a bad movie, a B movie (umm) and I really do think that
NEUTRAL	Hi, I'm here to review the movie The House of Yes
NEUTRAL	 Starring Parker Posey, Josh Hamilton, (umm) Tori Spelling, Freddie Prinz Junior
NEUTRAL	 (umm) This was a movie about an eccentric rich family living in Massachussetts who are (umm) obsessed by the Kennedys
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Josh Hamilton plays the son, he's bringing his fiance to meet his family for the first time
NEUTRAL	 (umm) His his (stutter) mother tries to buy her off (uhh) but it's his sister Parker Posey who is (umm) completely obscene, {laughs} or not obscene, insane and obsessed (umm) by her brother who probably most frightens us (uhh) in this movie
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) The movie is billed as a dark comedy but (uhh) I didn't really find it all that funny, I found it kind of ridiculous and (uhh) maybe bizarre
NEGATIVE	 If if (stutter) that's a good word
POSITIVE	 (uhh) I think the best line in the movie comes from Tori Spelling when she looks at Parker Posey and says no you're not insane you're just incredibly spoiled
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) The House of Yes a rounding no
NEUTRAL	Hey, y'all
NEUTRAL	 It's the king of movies here, and today I'm going to review ten thousand BC, (uhh) which recently came out in theaters
NEUTRAL	 Some of it's kind of bad
NEGATIVE	 (umm) There, it just wasn't my cup of tea
NEGATIVE	 Wasn't well executed, pretty formulaic, bad ending, wouldn't recommend watching it
NEUTRAL	 It's (uhh) from the director of Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow
NEGATIVE	 And (uhh) while I found those films (uhh), particularly Independence Day, to be pretty good, (umm) (uhh) ten thousand BC fails in that department
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It's about basically a, a (stutter) tribe of people who, (uhh) you know, like someone who (uhh) one, one (stutter) person gets (uhh) like a princess kind of deal happens where (uhh) she gets kidnapped and basically the tribe goes out to rescue her and then they meet other tribes and a whole kind of war happens
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I thought the ending especially was, (uhh) was pretty horrible
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) I don't want to ruin it, but (uhh) they, let's just say that they tried to surprise the audience all of the sudden with (uhh) a kind of (uhh) (uhh) just just (stutter) new (stutter) introduction of new characters, and I thought that was fairly week and disappointing
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It's, (uhh) it's been getting (uhh) pretty negative reviews by the press, but I tried to go into it with an open mind, (uhh) particularly because I liked Independence Day and (uhh) unfortunately it failed
NEUTRAL	 The CGI, (uhh) there was a lot of CGI
NEUTRAL	 Some of it's good
POSITIVE	Hello, today I'm going to review Semi-Pro starring Will Ferrell this is a movie that's basically a vehicle for more crazy Will Ferrell zany antics (uhh) he's playing a basketball player this time and that's basically all the plot there is to it
NEGATIVE	 It really has no plot, just an excuse for Will Ferrell to do crazy dumb things and (uhh) basically I think Will Ferrell might be out of schtick (uhh) all of his movies have been kind of dropping off into being repetitive and dumber and dumber and this one is probably the worst movie he's ever made
NEGATIVE	 This has happened to a lot of the Saturday Night Live alum and (uhh) speaking of Saturday Night Live movies it's just to give you an idea, I would say of all the bad movies that have ever come out of their characters this one would probably just barely beat Ladies Man
NEGATIVE	 This is a really bad movie, it has no plot whatsoever and I really had high hopes for it because at his best Will Ferrell can be (uhh) apparently zany and funny, but spent a lot of money advertising (uhh) this movie, had multiple spots during the superbowl
NEUTRAL	 They even put the semi-pro character into the sports illustrated swimsuit edition
NEGATIVE	 You really couldn't get away from it and then you see the movie and really, really disappointing and it kind of think if it spent some money on writing instead of advertising it might have been a little bit better
NEUTRAL	Hi
NEUTRAL	 Today I'm reviewing the movie, The Happening
NEGATIVE	 (umm) {clears throat} My problem with this movie isn't so much the plot
POSITIVE	 (umm) It was probably a good idea when M
NEGATIVE	 Night Shyamalan created it, when he thought of it, (umm) but unfortunately, most of the time, the actors actually find themselves walking or running, rather, away from the wind
NEGATIVE	 They run away from the wind
NEGATIVE	 (umm) If that sounds exciting to you then maybe you can go check this movie out, but otherwise, don't bother
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The problem is also that the dialogue and the acting are atrocious
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) That's probably the best word I can use to describe this movie is just atrocious
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The Village and Lady in the Water were sub-par movies compared to the three movies that he made originally, but they were at least well made films (uhh) this I'm surprised this movie actually got any kind of release, any kind of distribution
NEGATIVE	 The dialogue is horrible
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Dialogue's never really been his strong suit, but he usually casts decent enough actors or, at least, gets the best out of the actors that he casts to make up for it
NEUTRAL	 (umm) The Happening is the latest movie from writer director M
POSITIVE	 (uhh) With Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson, (umm) Paul Giamatti, (uhh) Bryce Dallas Howard, they're all decent actors in his movies
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I don't know if it was teaming up with Mark Wahlberg, who has is notori notoriously (stutter) wooden actor I don't know if that hurt the film, or not, but he also did not get anything out of John Leguizamo or Zooey Deschanel, who are usually pretty fine actors themselves
NEGATIVE	 So, I don't know what exactly happened here, but the acting, it feels like the words are being read off of a script
NEGATIVE	 As you're watching the movie it looks like they're actually looking at cue cards and reading these words for the first time, that's how the delivery is
NEGATIVE	 And it doesn't help that the words they're delivering are just dumb
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I almost walked out of the movie, but I wanted to stay till the end
NEUTRAL	 I wanted to see how it wrapped up
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The beginning of the film where the construction workers start to kill themselves, it's towards the very beginning of the film, (uhh) that was the first real sign of trouble, for me, was the acting by the lead construction worker
NEGATIVE	 And, from there, it just went downhill and it went really over the top when (uhh) they were in some diner and a lady is looking at her iPhone, which is horrible product placement, and watching some ridiculous video about a guy in a tiger pit
NEGATIVE	 Obviously CG
POSITIVE	 Night Shyamalan, who previously directed the good movies Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs
NEGATIVE	 Bad CG
NEGATIVE	 Just terribly done
NEGATIVE	 Terribly delivered dialogue while they're watching it
NEGATIVE	 It's just an awful movie
NEGATIVE	 I'm only gonna give this one one out of five stars
NEGATIVE	 I don't recommend anybody ever seeing this
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) This is the kind of movie that's gonna to be ridiculed in five years on DVD by drunken Frat boys because it's just that awful
NEGATIVE	 And the not so good movies The Village and Lady in the Water
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Unfortunately, this one can't even fit into the not so good movies category (umm) I'll get to that in a little bit
NEUTRAL	 (umm) The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as a science teacher and Zooey Deschanel as his wife (umm) and also stars John Leguizamo as his friend
NEUTRAL	 And something happens at the beginning of the movie and, for some reason, people start talking funny and killing themselves
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The cause of this is never fully explained
NEGATIVE	 (umm) There are theories that are thrown about and the big theory is pretty silly
NEUTRAL	Hey everybody, this is Tom and today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Hancock
POSITIVE	 As always, bam, movie ticket, right there
NEGATIVE	 And eventually he gets himself into trouble where he (stutter) he ends up saving a public relations guy and he tries to build up his image to get people to like him
NEUTRAL	 That is the story of this
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Okay the one thing that drove me nuts was the camera
NEUTRAL	 Yes
NEGATIVE	 Half the time the camera was doing three-sixties
NEGATIVE	 So I think I kinda want to do the rest of this review doing nothing but three-sixties but that would drive you guys nuts, cause it drove me nuts
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Maybe I was the only one who noticed, who knows
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It it (stutter) was funny at times, but, you know, (stutter) it wasn't good enough for me
NEGATIVE	 (stutter) No
NEGATIVE	 I I (stutter) didn't enjoy it, I I (stutter) just kind of sat there "Hmm
NEUTRAL	 Out of the way
NEGATIVE	 Okay
POSITIVE	 This was funny
NEGATIVE	 Why am I spending my money watching this?" {sigh} I think I was more sad that I spent the money to watch this but (umm) otherwise it is funny enough to watch it, but not funny enough to watch it in theaters
NEGATIVE	 Wait to rent it if you're really desperate, buy it if you want to
NEGATIVE	 (stutter) Don't know, it's more up to you
NEGATIVE	 I'm going to give this a two out five, hope it helps
NEUTRAL	 Alright, Hancock
NEGATIVE	 It is a Will Smith attempt at making a superhero movie in a summer of really good superhero movies
NEUTRAL	 Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Dark Knight
POSITIVE	 Okay, as you can tell I'm doing this a little bit past the point when Hancock came out, but you see where I'm going with this
NEGATIVE	 Hancock is not good
NEGATIVE	 One, no one has ever heard of this, two, I hope nobody will remember this cause this was a bad movie
POSITIVE	 Okay, it had its funny points because it's about a bum on the streets who has superhuman abilities
NEUTRAL	Hey all
NEUTRAL	 It's the king of movies here and today I'm going to review (uhh) The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) There's some CGI in, CGI in (stutter) here that isn't very good and (uhh) usually there shouldn't be a problem but (uhh) it just detracts from the experience I think
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) (stutter) It ends up being a little (uhh) a little disappointing
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) There's also just not that much (stutter) stuff in terms of originality
POSITIVE	 It's a lot like the other Mummies, if you've seen those and you like them you'll probably want to just see this cause you'll like it too
NEUTRAL	 If you're looking for even like a slight twist in the Mummy formula you probably won't wanna bother watching this because you're not going to be getting something like that
POSITIVE	 So once again, if you, if you (stutter) enjoy just popcorn movies like even Journey to the Center of the Earth, if you like that (uhh) you might want to check this out
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Unfortunately this one isn't in three D though, so it's not as entertaining but (stutter) I think this is strictly for Mummy fans and people that just want (uhh) some kind of escapist movie to forget about their worries for ninety minutes
NEUTRAL	 And that's my review of The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) In this movie they actually go to China and that's the whole dragon thing and that's why Jet Li is in it, in case you were wondering
NEUTRAL	 Now (uhh) this is a new movie (uhh) starring (stutter) Brendan Fraser, Jet Li, and Maria Bello and it's the third (uhh) movie in the, The Mummy series
NEUTRAL	 I believe the last one was actually in two-thousand-one or two-thousand-three
NEUTRAL	 It was definitely over five years ago so (umm) this is kind of a surprise in a way to see a sequel so soon, perhaps it's because (uhh) Indiana Jones four came out and people are kind of on that adventure wave right now
NEUTRAL	 They're, (uhh) they're enjoying their adventure kind of movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) This movie as as (stutter) the other ones were is is (stutter) not to be taken too seriously, it's pretty much popcorn entertainment
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It's just something that you watch, mindless fun (uhh) that you eventually, you know, just forget about pretty much immediately after watching it
NEGATIVE	 (umm) As as (stutter) popcorn entertainment it doesn't really (uhh) (uhh) fail necessarily, but it doesn't do its job as great as say even the first Mummy
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) The movie has Jet Li in it, which is a nice surprise, but I feel that if they (uhh) could have used him more in it (uhh) it would have been movie if they did
NEUTRAL	Hey expo Tv
NEUTRAL	 Today I am going to talk about another summer movie that is currently in theaters
NEUTRAL	 Vicky Cristina Barcelona
NEGATIVE	 (umm) xxx seen this with a few of my friends and I was much more soft having done so (umm) this film has little substance
NEGATIVE	 It's a Woody Allen film strangely enough which you would think that it would have some substance but not this one (umm) with some big name actors Javier Bardem (umm) Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz all on this film
NEUTRAL	 And basically what it is, I will give you the basic plot Penelope Cruz, her character and Scarlett Johansson's character (umm) travel to Barcelona (umm) and there you know they are alone and they are young females
NEGATIVE	 Basically there they just have (umm) relations with Javier Bardem's character (umm) and he's still involved with with his wife so it's kinda like a love quadrangle not a triangle cause there's three of them and one guy so quadrangle (umm) that's about as deep as the plot gets (umm) they try to do some cheesy plot development and cheesy character development
NEGATIVE	 It doesn't really work
NEUTRAL	 There's a little bit of humor in the film (umm) I think Woody Allen has an interesting sense of humor, a very dry sense of humor
NEGATIVE	 That I think worked with the film (umm) but originality wise, this movie is nothing that hasn't been made before It's just kinda sleezy (umm) waste of time completes your mind type of thing
NEUTRAL	Hey guys, Tina here and I want to do a review for you today of a movie that I just watched on DVD and the movie is called The Haunting, it's The Haunting of Molly Hartley
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) This is a rated R movie on DVD, it's just recently released on DVD and there aren't any well known (uhh) actors in this movie, a lot of no names
NEGATIVE	 I honestly can't name one character for you that I knew in this movie
NEUTRAL	 Some of the faces looked familiar but (umm) not so much that I would be able to name them for you
NEUTRAL	 It's basically (umm) based on the haunting of a high school student (uhh) who's haunted by her mother
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Apparently her mother tries to (uhh) kill her when she's younger and (umm) it really haunts her in terms of psychologically
NEUTRAL	 She has to see doctors and so forth
NEUTRAL	 I think it's more of a a (stutter) teen flick more than anything because it revolves a lot of the, the (stutter) things are based in the high school where (uhh) Molly goes to school at
POSITIVE	 (umm) I watched it with my eleven year old daughter and she really enjoyed it, she likes scary movies, and it does have some scary points in it
NEGATIVE	 I didn't really care for it, all I could say it's more of a a (stutter) teeny bop movie
POSITIVE	The system Accenture and Madrid Health Service have fully implemented is called the Madrid Electronic Health Record (HORUS) system . It captures all patient information into a single, integrated record for 26,000 clinicians to access across all parts of the regional healthcare system The system, with 15 million health records, was completed in 12 months.
POSITIVE	Hello, this is Linda Katehi, the chancellor at UC Davis, and I would like to speak with you through this video which will become the first of a series of such messages to connect with you.
NEGATIVE	When I was born into a poor family on a small Greek Island, women were not expected to even go to high school, let alone college.
NEGATIVE	The pepper spray incident was one that I will deeply regret for the rest of my life.
POSITIVE	We learned from it and we now do a better job protecting you and our campus.
NEGATIVE	It is unthinkable to believe that we would ever try to rewrite or erase history.
NEGATIVE	Regarding consultant contracts highlighted in the media, I regret that some of the language in those contracts misrepresents our intentions.
NEGATIVE	And let me assure you, your tuition, fees and state funds did not pay for the consultants work.
NEUTRAL	Learning from these mistakes, we are moving forward to increase transparency and accountability for my administration.

POSITIVE	Thanks to many tough decisions by our faculty, students and staff, we came out of this crisis financially stronger.
POSITIVE	Xenca was founded in 2012 by a team of experienced individuals with a thirty year track record of working together successfully in the cosmetics and healthcare industry
POSITIVE	 Their vision was to create a franchise consisting of a team of Associates who all share the same passion for helping people look and feel great
POSITIVE	 Now Xenca has hundreds of dedicated Associates who all love selling our products, that all tried and tested to really work
POSITIVE	 The beauty of being an Associate of Xenca is that when you're selling our products you know that they will really help people live better healthier life
NEUTRAL	Hello, I'm Matthew and I'm here to give you my review on this DVD movie called The Feeding
NEUTRAL	 It came out in two thousand six and it was directed by Paul Moore
NEGATIVE	 The acting was horrible in it
NEGATIVE	 Almost like they were reading cue cards
NEGATIVE	 The werewolf costume was completely unbelievable
NEGATIVE	 And it also had a person in it who kept shooting the wrong, missing the werewolf when it shot at it and (stutter) shooting the college kids
NEUTRAL	 So she ended up killing about four of them because she was such a bad shot
NEGATIVE	 This movie, how it got made I don't know
NEGATIVE	 How it got released on DVD I don't know, but it was quite comical to watch and on a scale of one to ten I would probably give it a one
NEGATIVE	 Besides that I can't tell you the rest of the cast, it really has a bunch of nobodies in it
NEUTRAL	 (umm) The storyline is a bunch of college students go camping in the woods and there is a werewolf which is chasing them
NEUTRAL	 This is definitely an independent film
NEGATIVE	 How it got made I don't know
NEGATIVE	 This movie was quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life
POSITIVE	 But almost to a point that was very funny
NEUTRAL	 It was shot on a very low budget
NEGATIVE	 It was shot really kind of grainy
NEUTRAL	Hi, I'm (uhh) reviewing the movie called (uhh) the Epic movie, which is currently in theaters and (umm) you know I've seen commercials on TV and (uhh) it's basically a type of movie like Scary Movie, like the series where they make spoofs of everything, and (uhh) I've seen it on TV and (uhh) it looked (uhh) pretty funny from the (stutter) from the previews that I saw
NEUTRAL	 (umm) I saw that over the weekend, did did (stutter) good in the box office
NEUTRAL	 I think it got something like over twenty million dollars
NEGATIVE	 So (umm) I decided to pay ten dollars, you know, go to the movie theater and see it and (uhh) gotta tell you that I'm extremely disappointed in the movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) For more than half of the movie, I didn't even laugh
NEUTRAL	 (umm) The only time I did laugh was at the the (stutter) pretty dirty stuff which they usually don't put in movies but, I mean that was pretty funny to me
NEGATIVE	 (umm) there are a couple of rap music scenes from from BET, that were trying to make fun of, wasn't really funny
NEUTRAL	Hey guys, (uhh) I'm going to do a quick review on the movie called Epic Movie
NEUTRAL	 It's basically a movie (uhh) comedy satire (uhh) it's it (stutter) mocks movies such as the (uhh) Da Vinci Code, Nacho Libre, X-Men, (umm) Land of Narnia, (uhh) Chocolate Factory, and some other movies I can't really think of right now
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) it it's (stutter) a movie that you don't really don't need brains to go watch it
NEGATIVE	 It's a lot of toilet humor and cheap laughs, and if you are really really really desperate for that kind of a comedy, I highly recommend this movie for you
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I mean if you are expecting (uhh) a lot more, I mean with this type of movie I don't think you will enjoy it
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It's, it's (stutter) got a pretty, pretty (uhh) low rating (umm) right now, but it's doing very well surprisingly, in the box office
NEUTRAL	 So if you're really desperate for (uhh) I mean, cheap laughs and that sort of (uhh) genre movie I would highly recommend (uhh) this movie to you
NEUTRAL	I'm here tonight because I just have something to get off my chest.
NEUTRAL	When Rob Talbert, the previous host, says it got out of hand it got out of hand.
NEGATIVE	Perhaps not Rob Talbert, but people at Machinima, writers and workers of that show before Chris Lockey came on -mind you, Chris Lockey was doing this by himself: very little support- and we still didn't cut him a break.
NEGATIVE	It's also sad that in the final episode, Chris Lockey didn't even show up; [he] probably didn't feel good about it.
NEGATIVE	Like I said, we've all lost a series now, so I'll have to direct my video game retrospective...fix somewhere else.
NEUTRAL	I guess this is a good time to mention that there's a person called the Nostalgic Gamer.
POSITIVE	His channel, NostalgicGamer86: it's a great place for video game retrospectives.
NEGATIVE	You were probably aware of the controversy involving the new format of the show went through a few weeks back, mainly involving the new host Chris Lockey.
NEGATIVE	It's obviously too little, too late, but I just feel the need.
NEGATIVE	Flawed, yes, but he would've gotten better if we had given him a chance.
NEGATIVE	But, we never really did, and instead of leaving good, constructive criticism most of us just decided to leave complaints.
NEGATIVE	And now, because of that, Machinima got intimidated, and decided to shut down the show entirely: costing us a good quality series and Chris Lockey a job.
NEUTRAL	KATHLEEN MCCARTNEY: I'm Kathleen McCartney, president of Smith College.
POSITIVE	Students hear from the activists directly, a bridging of theory and practice that is distinctly Smith.
POSITIVE	I'm proud to present this dynamic online experience of Smith college, and proud to feature the remarkable stories of women who are transforming our world.
NEUTRAL	Our first MOOC reflects Smith College's ambitions and values in six important ways.
NEUTRAL	The course offers the same rigorous content that students find in traditional Smith classrooms.
POSITIVE	It invites dialogue and debate, hallmarks of learning and development.
NEUTRAL	It supports the democratization of knowledge, by making course content available to the world.
NEUTRAL	She has designed it for anyone interested in psychological theories of social change, and the transformative potential of women's activism.
NEUTRAL	&gt;&gt;JACK KITAEFF: The time is right to elect a president of the American Psychological Association from outside of traditional governance.
NEUTRAL	I've been a member of the APA for 35 years, but have never held elective office and have not been part of APA politics or governing activities.
POSITIVE	I will work toward making this effort historic in my tenure.
POSITIVE	As the only candidate with a military and police psychology background, I am uniquely qualified in these areas.
NEUTRAL	In light of recent events, I furthermore intend to create a division of human rights within APA, reporting directly to the president.
NEGATIVE	I will furthermore address the proliferation of hate crimes and the emergence of homegrown terrorism in the United States.
POSITIVE	Psychology is in a unique position to address these issues and I am in a unique position to direct this effort.
NEGATIVE	Other candidates for the office of president are silent on these issues and are standing still in these efforts.
POSITIVE	The time is now to tap into this group who is passionate about the future of psychology, but have allowed others, often the same people over and over again, to assume leadership roles.
POSITIVE	I am the only candidate for president who is both a lawyer and a psychologist.
NEUTRAL	During these recent difficult times, a president with knowledge of the law and a strong allegiance to ethical and legal principals affecting our profession is necessary.
NEUTRAL	The past three presidents of the United States have worked toward achieving mental health parity.
POSITIVE	The only way to be remembered is to be enthusiastic and conversation in your style.
POSITIVE	If you're looking for a degree in entrepreneurship, we have an excellent program.
POSITIVE	We're one of the few universities that are 100 percent holding online that have a dedicated entrepreneurship degree program.
NEUTRAL	Many other universities out there have entrepreneurship minors or tracks or concentrations but it's within a school within business administration and is not an entrepreneurship degree itself and so that's something else that really differentiates us.
POSITIVE	We have a bachelor's that's completely entrepreneurship based and master's completely entrepreneurship based.
POSITIVE	We want to make sure that when students come through the Entrepreneurship Program whether it's the bachelor's and master's that we don't graduate a student that just has the degree in hand, but we graduate an entrepreneur, and that they can continue on with their venture in that we've helped them to succeed with the dreams that they have.
POSITIVE	While taking my degree I have lived most of the time Nigeria, Africa.
POSITIVE	I barely took three courses before I had to go back home as my job demanded, and so every other course since then has been from Nigeria.
POSITIVE	I remember takin a course on enterpreneurship and that seemed like the entire reason why I was here.
POSITIVE	It seemed to encompass everything about Business Administration I needed and professor you know was right on the ball.
NEUTRAL	This is the movie Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I really couldn't watch the whole show, but basically it's about (uhh) the blood orchid is a rare flower and it holds the secret to eternal life and they start to (uhh), you know they go into the jungles to find, to hunt for it
NEGATIVE	 And of course they, the (uhh) stories about an (stutter) anaconda and so you they find this giant anaconda that (umm) was in the movie and I couldn't even stand to look at it
NEGATIVE	 So (uhh) I didn't watch the whole show but if you are afraid of snakes or anything you'd probably have your eyes closed the whole movie so I I (stutter) didn't like it
NEGATIVE	 Just looking at this cover with the snake on it I don't like it
NEUTRAL	 Anyways this is (umm) let me see if they have any special features
NEGATIVE	 The special features are deleted scenes, previews, and (uhh), and the making of the feature so
NEGATIVE	 All of the actors are (uhh) let's see Johnny Mess, Messner (stutter) KaDee Strickland, Matthew Marsden, Eugene Bird, Salli Richardson-Whitfield, Nicholas Gonzalaz
NEUTRAL	 Those are are the actors
POSITIVE	And in today's world that means going beyond high school to a community college, a 4-year university or professional training program.
POSITIVE	It's about inspiring young people across this country to complete their education.
POSITIVE	And I know that if we truly want to help all our young people reach their college dreams, we need to support our school counselors.
POSITIVE	So I want to thank you all again for your leadership and I look forward to working with all of you in the months and years ahead to inspire our young people to reach higher and fulfill their boundless promise.
NEUTRAL	And today we're talking about your major assignment, the literature review
NEUTRAL	Potter and Granger did a good study in 2012 about decision-making, involving parents in the decision-making process
POSITIVE	There's a reason we have your literature review due at end of Week 4
POSITIVE	And that's because we're going to have all of Week 5 for your instructor to pass it back to you, so you can make some revisions to it
NEUTRAL	It's very rare that the literature review is OK'd in the first draft
POSITIVE	So please as you submit this, consider it a first draft of something that's going to have a couple iterations
NEUTRAL	So let's say, again, we're talking about methods of parent involvement
POSITIVE	And I found some good studies
NEUTRAL	Larry, Moe and Curly did a great study in 1997 about involving the community
POSITIVE	As I said earlier, just to follow on
POSITIVE	It’s a great delight to see so many of you here today from five participating schools
NEUTRAL	The motion before us today is: This House considers that environmental protection of the Arctic is more important than the need for economic development and job creation
POSITIVE	And that is exactly one of the key area of the report that we ourselves will be looking at
NEUTRAL	The most fulfilling result of the work that scientists and researchers do is coming close to knowing how the natural world works
NEUTRAL	For scientific samples to be gathered the Arctic must be preserved
NEUTRAL	Further knowledge of any change can rapidly be known
NEGATIVE	But economic development, such as mining who are limiting the amount of natural resources and landscapes that the researchers and natural scientists can use
NEUTRAL	MR KIRBY: A quick note on this airstrike, which I know many of you have covered or have asked about, in Aleppo on a Doctors Without Borders hospital.
NEUTRAL	But I didn’t want to relinquish the podium at the outset without mentioning that we’re obviously – find this attack reprehensible in every possible way.
NEGATIVE	We’re looking at dozens, if not several dozens, of casualties in this strike on what was clear that was a medical facility.
NEGATIVE	So once again, we call on the regime to cease these absolutely senseless attacks, which are, of course, violations of the cessation of hostilities.
NEGATIVE	But again, you’re going to hear more from the Secretary on this very shortly, but I did want to just put that out there right at the top since I know you’ve all been interested in it and it just happened.
NEUTRAL	Digital consumers really have changed as we’ve seen the age demographics start to shift and seeing the bloomers becoming older and then the Gen X-ers and Gen Y-ers really getting into the space, especially for health care and pharmaceuticals.
POSITIVE	So it’s a matter of finding the right fit for the right individual.
POSITIVE	It’s a big difference and a big shift from mass marketing to really targeted marketing, and that’s where we’re headed at least.

POSITIVE	[Annison] "It's the first time in history that regular people like you and I can actually invest in film and television and content projects." [Scanlan] "We love Hollywood, we love pop culture, this is why we're doing this.
POSITIVE	But we also believe if you look at some of the major investments happening... there's not a lot of new franchises being born anymore." [Cambrie] Aside from fan investors, will individual content creators be able to get involved with Legion M?
POSITIVE	[Annison] "If there's some creator on Youtube and you're like 'Oh my God, this guy needs to have his own series' or something like that, that's what we want to hear." [Scanlan] "This is about opening the gates to Hollywood and bringing the fans into the inner circle... it's a win-win across the board." For NewsBeat Social, I'm Cambrie Caldwell.
POSITIVE	Today I'm going to be sharing with you my favorite Gillette product.
POSITIVE	But the other nice thing about these razors is even after this is gone, the blades do last a really long time.
NEUTRAL	So I'm able to still actually get a longer lifetime out of these.
NEUTRAL	And after these are gone, I do go ahead and just lather up and use that so that I can shave.
POSITIVE	But I really liked these, and I would highly recommend them.
POSITIVE	They're a little bit on the expensive side, but I figured it's worth it, because I don't have to buy razors as often.
NEUTRAL	Sometimes I can get one razor to last for anywhere from four to six months.
POSITIVE	And I really like these because it's basically a two-in-one on the razor.
POSITIVE	I like the Breeze ones a little bit better, because I've noticed this doesn't tend to-- the jelly soap doesn't tend to melt as fast as some of the other brands.
NEUTRAL	Or not the other brands, but the other types that Venus has out there.
NEGATIVE	- The financial aid process was a long, arduous one for me to learn about.
NEUTRAL	There are tons of different financial aid; each college does it differently.
NEUTRAL	Sometimes you might have to learn about how one school does it and how another.
NEUTRAL	There's a lot of similarities a lot of times so they can transfer, but you always have to be specific with any college that you look into.
NEUTRAL	It's a learning process, each college is different in some ways, one of the things I did is I contacted a financial aid officer at the school to learn a little bit more about the process, and so that's how I worked it out.
NEUTRAL	Little heads-up for you -- that sometime on February 12th at block 630,720, we will have our annual decrease of inflation
NEUTRAL	This means that Dash's block reward -- that is the reward to miners, masternodes, and the available treasury -- will decrease by 7
NEUTRAL	And as an interesting little fun fact for you, the February superblock -- that is, the February treasury payout -- has supported a new all-time high of proposals: 22

NEGATIVE	 I would rather buy that movie, (uhh) the Rear Window I mean, than to see this one again
NEGATIVE	 If you do want to see this wait for it to come out on video and rent it, don't buy it
NEUTRAL	 So he starts watching out his window, watching people for entertainment until he sees (uhh) something that basically (uhh) horrifies him
NEGATIVE	 He thinks his neighbor is actually a murderer but there is really nothing that he can do about it because he is under house arrest
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) If this plot sounds very familiar I think I saw this movie (uhh) many years ago
POSITIVE	 It actually came out about forty years and it was called A Rear Window and it starred Jimmy Stewart, and he was confined to his house because his leg was broken and in general I think that is a much better movie than the movie I have just seen in theaters
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) I kind of felt a little bit cheated because (uhh) the plot is (uhh) very similar
POSITIVE	 You know, Jimmy Stewart relies on the people around him and his girlfriend to kind of investigate and figure out what was going on
NEGATIVE	 Saw a lot of the same things happen in this movie and (uhh) this movie felt a little bit cheaper
NEGATIVE	 They kind of tried to stylize it a little bit (uhh) for the younger audience but in general (uhh) I really didn't think it was worth the money

NEUTRAL	  I applied for Kingston University 2 years ago,  but I took a gap year,  as I felt like I want to travel around and experience new things,  and Kingston allowed me to defer my entry for a year.
POSITIVE	 I also have an eye condition,  I would’ve thought that it might be a boundary to my education,  although there’s a wide range of support available,  which allows me to access lectures and slides which I can print out and take with me lectures,  as sometimes even with my contact lenses in, I struggle to see what’s actually written,  in the lectures.
POSITIVE	Anyway if you've got any questions about anything related  to Statistics, Maths or anything about student life at Kingston,  feel free to ask me and I will try my best to answer.
NEUTRAL	And seeing the NASCAR fan decide to learn a little bit more about Nationwide and then that gives us a chance to remind them to go back to the Turner site and catch up on racing.

NEUTRAL	 I I (stutter) mean in the original Star Wars, people actually acted it

NEUTRAL	 (uhh) This whole season is about him {clears throat} joining the (uhh) cast of (uhh) The Producers, featuring Mel Brooks
NEUTRAL	Hi, this is Rhett Reiger from White Caspian Studios on behalf of Expert Village.
NEUTRAL	You have to look for many different issues, like pay scale, what do they expect to be paid, or do they not, or will they defer their payment until the end of the shoot, or until the movie makes money.
NEUTRAL	Now the director is very involved, intimately involved with the casting.
POSITIVE	Hey ExpoTV, I'm Dea, and I generally love sort of these bad teen comedy sort of movies
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) But like I said, generally which implies that I don't always love them
NEGATIVE	 One that I didn't love was Drive Me Crazy (umm) this is a movie with Melissa Joan Hart, where her character, she's trying to (uhh) she's trying to like, get the popular basketball guy or whatever to ask her out
NEUTRAL	 And so and her best friend next door neighbor guy, is trying to win back his exgirlfriend
POSITIVE	 So they turn to each other
NEGATIVE	 You know, to sort of fake a relationship to make those two jealous, Melissa Joan Hart gives him a makeover, and it's all, it all (stutter) feels very like, it's not, it's not, (stutter) it doesn't have the sort of undercurrent of satire that a lot of high school comedies have, that sort of make them funny

NEGATIVE	 (umm) {clears throat} The acting in this one is not really acting so much as one person fights and beats the crap out of others, (umm) the other star of the movie makes loud-mouth, (uhh) off-color remarks through the entire thing
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It's supposed to be hilariously funny, it's unfortunately not
NEUTRAL	 It's quite the opposite

NEUTRAL	Hey again guys
NEUTRAL	 xxx I am reviewing today is the movie Team America World Police, specifically this is the censored and unrated version
NEUTRAL	 (umm) The team who made this is the team (uhh) xxx parker
POSITIVE	 (uhh) They were the mind behind South Park, a very popular television show
NEGATIVE	 And also (umm) the movie xxx, not so good but (umm) I guess they should really stick to TV because this isn't that good of a movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It's all about puppets (umm) sort of the like parody of the old seventies puppet television shows, (umm) but it is not that good it (uhh) it tries to be kind of (uhh) sexy and (uhh) taken into account like political themes like Kim Jong Eun (umm) is the bad guy and (uhh) there's a bunch of like (uhh) celebrities in it who would team up with him because they are like super liberal celebrities
NEGATIVE	 The plots kind of (stutter) but I mean puppets so what do you want
NEUTRAL	Hey
NEUTRAL	 Today I'm going to be reviewing the two disc special edition of The Hulk widescreen
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) The special effects are nice, but not enough to warrant any kind of purchase or rental
NEGATIVE	 I kind of wish I didn't have this
NEUTRAL	 I give it a two
NEGATIVE	 It's, it's not as bad as, as (stutter) a one but like I said there's very, very little here to reclaim it and make it valuable
NEGATIVE	 This (uhh) is a pretty ridiculous movie
NEUTRAL	 It covers the story of the Hulk, a man who is (uhh) a scientist exposed to gamma radiation and then ever since that exposure when he becomes angry he turns into the Hulk, a huge green (uhh) monster man with (uhh) unlimited power and invulnerability, and with the added feature that the angrier the Hulk gets the more powerful and more invulnerable he becomes
NEUTRAL	 So basically it's a, it's a story, this is a story about a man who who (stutter) suffers because he can't control his anger, but also uses this anger to lash out at society and his oppressors
NEUTRAL	 The movie kind of glosses over a lot of the (uhh) (stutter) a lot of the things that you could say with a story like that in favor of just pure action
NEUTRAL	 The Hulk smashing tanks and smashing helicopters and jumping thousands of miles, and while that's entertaining it's I also don't think that's enough
NEGATIVE	 I think you could have done a little bit more with this movie, with the subject matter
NEGATIVE	 But portraying him as a tortured soul a little bit better, I don't know
NEGATIVE	 But as it is, it's a, it's a (stutter) fairly entertaining movie but very, very brainless
NEUTRAL	Now, something else you want to be aware of is evaluating each particular situation, every time you're in it.

NEUTRAL	I'm a photographer and digital retouching artist here in New York City.
NEUTRAL	In this clip, we're going to take a look at how to insert a picture into another picture in Photoshop.
NEUTRAL	If it is in a classroom type situation, you are at much more of an advantage than if you are giving a speech to a group of people that you possibly will never see before you give the speech.
NEUTRAL	If your product is technologically superior to others on the market, demonstrate it, and make it easy for anyone to see how much better your product or service is.
NEUTRAL	Rule number two, do not rely on your presentation alone to make the pitch.
POSITIVE	Only face to face can you distinguish your product and make connections that could become fruitful relationships down the road.
POSITIVE	So provide the space in your booth where you can be comfortable and talk about the features and benefits of your product.
POSITIVE	Remember, those guys with the checkbooks still like to do business across the table or at the bar, not everything is best sold on the world wide web.
NEUTRAL	Although if you don't have a website that matches your trade show image, well, you need to develop that site, before the trade show.
NEUTRAL	Unless you closed the deal and came back with a signed contract what you really have is a warm lead.
NEGATIVE	Rule number four, don't try this with a bad product or service.
POSITIVE	I'm a firm believer in top down selling, and the people who either write the checks or tell other people to write the checks attend the big shows.
POSITIVE	Good luck, and good business, I'm Peggy Collins, and that's how to make your next trade show a huge success.

NEUTRAL	But did you know that businesses also have an unofficial organization chart?
NEUTRAL	Since the entrepreneur business owner is usually the number one finder in a company this dilution of the critical Finder's role can lead to a downward cycle where growth declines, expenses increase, and cash runs out.
NEUTRAL	Know who's in it and follow the B2B CFO® golden rule; Let the Finders find, Minders mind, and Grinders grind.
POSITIVE	Here's what I mean, every company's unofficial org chart is comprised of just three types of employees; Finders, Minders and Grinders.
NEUTRAL	Finders are entrepreneurial and are future thinkers who generate new business and build new and leverage relationships that multiply the volumes and revenues of the business.
NEUTRAL	Grinders are the employees that do the actual work of the company.
NEUTRAL	They're the ones who build and ship the products or deliver the services.
NEUTRAL	When a company experiences growth, typically Finders stop finding new work and start spending most of their time doing Minding and Grinding activity.

NEGATIVE	In 1864, some people had always been able to own other people
NEGATIVE	In 1918, women could not vote
NEUTRAL	In 1989, people with disabilities were not considered people
POSITIVE	We fundamentally changed those things and we became a better, smarter, stronger nation because of it
POSITIVE	So yes, we are asking people to change the way they’ve always done things, the same way we have always fundamentally changed things, when we change them for the better
NEUTRAL	But there’s something else I have to say, is that if we do that, if we make that commitment, someone somewhere is going to get hurt
POSITIVE	And so it's that fine line, and consumers are smarter than ever today.
POSITIVE	There's certain corporate essentials which every company should track above and beyond your minute book.
NEUTRAL	One of these things is the financial data which everybody knows because the government requires it for taxes to be filed at the end of the year the other thing which many early stage companies forget is the human resources making sure you have good documentation for every one of your team members.
NEGATIVE	Don't end up in this situation track all of your human resources and make sure everyone who works for you is under contract from the beginning and keep it all organized and loaded in IncMind.

POSITIVE	You are going to want to go to  the show in comfortable shoes, and eat a big breakfast.
POSITIVE	You may even get in a quick workout so you are prepared for the long day ahead.
POSITIVE	Thank you for listening from my tips  for professional buyers for the NY NOW Market.
POSITIVE	And after the trade show be sure  to visit Bonagora.com to learn how to enhance your  professional buying experience in between the trade show seasons.
NEUTRAL	So Handmade opens on Saturday  and closes on Tuesday, but Home, Gift and New  all open on Sunday and close on Wednesday.
NEUTRAL	You'll want to be sure to visit  the NY NOW website in advance for full show dates and hours.
NEUTRAL	The NY NOW website also offers a  comprehensive exhibitors search, so you can map out which vendors  you plan to visit in advance.
NEUTRAL	A helpful hint is that if you are  looking for a booth number on the fly, you can download the NY NOW  mobile app when you get to the show.
NEUTRAL	If you go to the show looking to add only your most profitable and best-selling categories, it would avoid impulse buying.
NEGATIVE	A lot of people who come to Las Vegas have never had any criminal problems in their life before.
NEUTRAL	I'm attorney Michael Becker of the Las Vegas Defense Group.
NEUTRAL	If you've been arrested in Las Vegas, or anywhere in the state of Nevada, call us at 702-DEFENSE.
NEGATIVE	And for a lot of people, being arrested or being cited and told to come back to court to face a misdemeanor charge is a very upsetting prospect.
NEUTRAL	A trespassing charge, in the whole grand scheme of things, is not such a big deal.
NEGATIVE	They don't want to have to explain a bad night when they're filling out a job application.
NEUTRAL	And so, for those people, it's important that we try to negotiate a resolution to a trespassing charge that would result in a dismissal of the charges so they don't have to keep explaining it or sealing of the record at some time thereafter.
NEUTRAL	So we can keep their record clean so it doesn't come back to haunt them in the future.
NEUTRAL	You need to know that that seller financing will take second lien holders position on the deed.
NEUTRAL	A real estate attorney needs to be involved in writing the contract.
NEGATIVE	No country on earth would remain passive in the face of hundreds of rockets fired on its cities and Israel is no exception.
NEUTRAL	I appreciated their expressions of strong support for our right and our duty to defend ourselves, and this is what we will continue to do
NEGATIVE	 Today we expanded our operations against Hamas and the other terrorist groups in Gaza.
NEUTRAL	We will continue to protect our civilians against Hamas attacks on them.
NEGATIVE	It embeds its terrorists in hospitals, schools, mosques and apartment buildings throughout the Gaza Strip.
NEGATIVE	Hamas is thus committing a double war crime: It targets Israeli civilians, while hiding behind Palestinian civilians.
NEUTRAL	Now one thing about starting a photography business is that you want to really, seriously consider what you're doing.
NEGATIVE	I really frown upon going out and spending a large amount of money on the biggest and the best new equipment to start a business that you've never done before.
POSITIVE	So really, start out extremely small, take on photography jobs that are really making you a profit of, you know, not so much at first, just enough to almost break even, and then start building upon that and building upon your client base.
NEUTRAL	The more specific you are, the chances of you making are it are better.
NEUTRAL	People are going to go to you when you're the only person that does certain type of events, or photographs, let's say it's dancing.
NEUTRAL	I don't know, I'm just thinking off the top of my head, let's say it's kids dancing.
NEGATIVE	So those are just some ways that I would start a small photography business.
NEGATIVE	Now this is sort of, I don't know, being a little, you know, you really want to look at it.
NEUTRAL	I mean, I'm trying to kind of make it a little bit comical, but to be really honest with you, it really gets to be that way sometimes for some photographers.
NEGATIVE	Where as they started out doing something they love and ended up actually hating it and just doing it for money, and in the end, I think sometimes that really shows.
NEGATIVE	like what should be the determining factor in whether or not someone is or is not my friend?
NEGATIVE	Because apparently not being friends with Craig because he's voting for people who are running their entire campaigns off the promises of committing war crimes is too superficial of a reason for you.
NEGATIVE	But the idea that there is absolutely no legitimate reason for someone like me to not be friends with someone who is voting for people like Donald Trump or Ted Cruz is really disconnected from the way that the world actually works.
NEGATIVE	Because my family's not rich enough for them to care about.
NEGATIVE	So yeah, sorry for me not wanting to be around people who think things like that.
NEGATIVE	I just- I really hate, that the people who say this act as if like political beliefs is like the dumbest, most superficial thing to stop being friends with someone over.
NEUTRAL	And the second thing that I think is very important is rethinking ethic in business.
POSITIVE	More and more we have to have transparency, collaboration and the lessons learned from the crisis help us to understand that the real next step after the crisis will be a much more committed economy to ethics and values that can support trust.
POSITIVE	Every day, we try to bring ourselves to the boundary between the known and the unknown and face the cloud
POSITIVE	So B is essential in order to get going, but C is much more profound, and that's the amazing thing about resesarch
NEUTRAL	The PwC and HfS Research report includes comprehensive analysis and research based on interviews and data collected from over 400 HR practitioners and over 350 global business executives.
POSITIVE	Among key findings, the study shows global expansion and changing workforce characteristics have elevated the importance of recruiting, talent management, and performance management in the workplace.

NEUTRAL	You first want to start by deciding whether if you're going to attend or not attend to.
NEUTRAL	Well, one reason that I write for teenagers is that when I went to high school, I actually went to two different high schools
NEGATIVE	 And at the first high school I was very, very unpopular to the point where I would sit down at the lunch table and people would move way
NEUTRAL	 A lot of human drama happens that would not happen in a grownup life where there’s no legal obligation to show up anywhere
POSITIVE	 And I also think that being a teenager is a very fascinating time of a person’s life
NEUTRAL	 Every single person in their teenage years in America is separating from their family of origin at least a little bit, is navigating money and transportation and changing body and increased independence
POSITIVE	 That’s true no matter what your economic or social situation is, no matter what your background is, small town, big town, countryside
NEUTRAL	 Your body’s changing, your relationship to your family of origin is changing, and a lot of other things are changing too
POSITIVE	 This is way more exciting than middle age
POSITIVE	 Right? This is the meat of becoming a person
NEUTRAL	 And after my sophomore year I transferred to a different school, and I didn’t change anything about myself
POSITIVE	 I just showed up at the new school, and all of a sudden I was really popular, and I had boyfriends and I went to dances and I was on the prom committee and I wrote for the paper
NEUTRAL	 It was a whole different life because nobody knew I was supposed to be a loser
NEUTRAL	 So, I experienced high school, if you think of it as a hierarchy, right, from the top of the hierarchy and from the bottom
POSITIVE	 And I don’t think that very many people get that chance
POSITIVE	 So, I think that has really helped me in being able to write characters with, you know, a variety of high school experiences
POSITIVE	 And high school is a fascinating setting, especially boarding school or summer camp where you really are stuck there
NEUTRAL	 I think when you have a place like high school where you’re legally obligated to show up every day, you cannot walk away
NEUTRAL	One of the challenges that we've had is that the word advertising doesn't even work anymore.

POSITIVE	may vary by species, some studies have shown emotions are perceived as more prominently expressed on the right side of a person’s face

POSITIVE	Researchers at the University of Iowa, found that pigeons can see similarities among human faces when it comes to identity and emotion
POSITIVE	Essentially, the pigeons could tell when the photographs they were shown were of the same person and when the emotions of different people were similar
POSITIVE	And, the research on dogs is particularly robust
POSITIVE	In one study, researchers at Azabu University, found dogs could learn to pick out photographs of smiling human faces from those with blank expressions
POSITIVE	And researchers from Kyoto University showed that dogs can match their owner’s face to their owner’s voice

NEUTRAL	 When we initially launched the system we decided that we were going to our BIS team and find all of our users that have already been logged on customers to our Internet site, and take those user names and push them into the Widen system and then market to those specific users, letting them know what kind of new system we were creating, what were the advantages of it, and push that out to them
POSITIVE	 We did a full back cover spread on our very first catalog when we launched the marketing toolbox, identifying what it was, how easy it was to use, and we came up with a quick little slogan to use to try to get them to understand that it was fast, easy and simple, which was basically our slogan that we used
POSITIVE	 And we highlighted it on that catalog that gets distributed out to about 10,000 addresses, which is a very large audience, to see how many would actually log on to our website, and come in and see the toolbox
NEUTRAL	 We gave that roughly about a couple months to see how that settled in
NEUTRAL	 Then we followed up with an email blast to identify that this new system was here and what were the advantages of using the system
NEUTRAL	 Then we followed up with a survey
POSITIVE	 We particularly were talking about our catalogs, and our sourcebooks and our marketing materials, but we felt that that was the perfect opportunity to then ask if they had seen the marketing toolbox advertised on the back of our catalog or advertised through our email blast, which gave us some insight as to how many people were really knowledged about it and what step we needed to take to implement further from there and whether we could move into a training position or whether we needed to continue on with our marketing efforts
POSITIVE	 From that we felt like there was a good enough number of customers who had seen it in the few places that we had put it out, and we moved into our training phase, which was launching WebExes a couple times a week for a few consecutive weeks in a row, and putting out open lines to all of our customers saying that they could attend a particular WebEx

NEUTRAL	Hi my name is Zach Parry
NEUTRAL	 Today I am going to be answering the question, "Is it legal to surf the deep web?" To answer that questions let's first get an understand what deep web is
NEUTRAL	 For example, if you were to get on the Clark County recorders website and you want to search recorded documents associated with a certain parcel number, or were you to get on a Clark County assessor's site or the Clark County District Court website and you wanted to search different cases, none of that is indexed
NEUTRAL	 In order to find that, you can't go through Google, you have to go through the portal on respective web sites
NEUTRAL	 So all that public information is unindexed and therefore as part of the deep web
NEUTRAL	 Yet, there's nothing wrong with searching for that information
NEUTRAL	 So, the question really is, what is it that you're looking for on the deep web, because certainly there are illegal activities going on beneath the radar of what is indexed
NEUTRAL	 So, yes it is legal to surf the web
NEUTRAL	 In and of itself, searching this information, and looking at information that is not indexed is not illegal
NEUTRAL	 There is nothing wrong with that
NEUTRAL	 The question is, what is it that you're doing because some of the activities on there, if you were looking for a contract killer, for example, that would be illegal
NEUTRAL	 So the answer depends on what the actual behavior is
NEUTRAL	 Because, when you get on Google on run a research and you're looking for information you're actually surfing the shallow web, if you will
NEUTRAL	 But surfing the deep web in and of itself is perfectly legal
NEUTRAL	 Lawyers Plus, We Earn Your Trust
POSITIVE	 Index meaning, Google has it in their algorithm and it could be a potential search result
NEUTRAL	 The deep web is the unindexed portion of the internet
NEUTRAL	 It's all that information that people put online that doesn't run through Google or that Google or other search engines cannot see
NEUTRAL	 In fact, the vast majority of information online is in the deep web
NEUTRAL	 And a lot of it is pretty benign
NEUTRAL	 Just because the information is uncharted or unmapped down't mean there is anything illegal about it
NEUTRAL	You learned in Financial Accounting about the income statement.
NEUTRAL	There are two approved ways of reporting income to external users.
NEUTRAL	So from contribution margin we subtract fixed costs and that equals our operating income this is the same operating income, that we have when we use the Multi-Step format.
NEUTRAL	Note the operating income of $9700. We will refer to that again at the end of this video, but now I wanna introduce you to a new format for the income statement known as the Contribution Margin Income Statement format.
NEUTRAL	This format is not acceptable for external reporting, but it is used almost exclusively for internal reporting and decision-making purposes.
NEUTRAL	Thus contribution margin is the incremental profit earned on each unit sold.

NEUTRAL	We have the latest from Utah, where the state has committed to spending millions of dollars to undo marriage equality.
NEGATIVE	An apology from a Florida governor who has now changed his mind on banning the freedom to marry.

NEUTRAL	Also last week, the state requested an emergency stay from the US Supreme Court.
NEUTRAL	If granted, the stay would halt marriage equality during the appeals process.
NEUTRAL	We could have a decision from the court on the stay any day now.
NEGATIVE	And I think I reflect the outrage of the ordinary citizen who feels very strongly about the notion that we were told that CEOs require those kinds of pay packages because they are tied to performance.
NEUTRAL	And then we find out that essentially the notion of corporate welfare is stronger than the notion of corporate performance.
NEUTRAL	So I believe very strongly that the average tax payer in the U.S.

NEGATIVE	And when we were walking into the house my little girl, she's six now, she got really nervous.
POSITIVE	And I said, honey don't be afraid, just grab a hold of daddy's hand.
POSITIVE	And immediately she grabbed my hand and all the fear and all the worry, the sound of her voice changed, and she was just totally confident walking into the house because she had her dad's hand.
POSITIVE	And the Lord spoke into my spirit and He just showed me how He's reaching His hand out to us.
NEUTRAL	He's reaching His hand out to you and to me and I'm going to cling to His Hand.

POSITIVE	 We are looking for people who have the best interests of you,  the American people, in mind  as they help us prepare to govern going forward.

NEUTRAL	STEVE HOCH: How are retailers being influenced and managing things like Facebook and Twitter and things like that?
POSITIVE	My guess is that the incentive is to have some rules so that people believe that it's relevant.
NEUTRAL	And, if you're not sure right off the top of your head, then you need to think about what makes this worthwhile.
POSITIVE	Well, it's worthwhile because it could help our planet, it could help our future generations.
NEUTRAL	So find that worth whileness and incorporate that into your speaking.

NEUTRAL	But their so-called Murabah in not halal at all, is actually Ribah to the back door
NEUTRAL	Now, there are specialty lenders out there, that do these construction or permanent loans, so my suggestion is to go to your local bank, or perhaps search online, for construction loans, and you will find lenders that do these loans for the construction period, and also find lenders that will do the loans on the lot.
NEUTRAL	I'm a fellow at the Committee of Conscience at the US Holocaust Museum, and I'm undertaking a research project that is pegged to the upcoming trial in the Hague of the alleged Bosnian war criminal Ratko Mladic, who is the most prominent of all the people who've been indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in the Hague.

NEUTRAL	Can it, could it have been prevented by the international community?
NEUTRAL	Of course, I'm going to, to be present at some of the trials.
NEUTRAL	The Mladic trial is in its pre-trial phase, so they're debating how exactly the trial will take place, exchanging evidence.
POSITIVE	The second suggestion is to use a "strategies approach"
NEUTRAL	There are strategies that children can use for thinking about each set of number facts
NEUTRAL	So if they were facing a number fact like 8+3 we would say we will count on 3 from 8
NEUTRAL	What are the next three numbers
NEUTRAL	Once the students have recalled and the number fact then of course they don't need the strategy and so that's the ultimate goal that they just recall it
NEUTRAL	So we can say, 8+3 and they go 11, that's easy
NEUTRAL	to a poor transaction using these mechanisms that are freely available to us
NEUTRAL	companies to know if they can be competitive

POSITIVE	Census Bureau does that's vitally important is provide data to U
NEUTRAL	and bring them into accordance with His will
NEGATIVE	While those who stop in religion and refuse to accept God's work of the last days, will be left in dark desolation

NEUTRAL	So there is no real perfect major for being pre-health, being pre-med.
POSITIVE	As long as you complete all the requirements that you need in order to get into a particular med school.
POSITIVE	Your major can be anything from English to Anthropology to Music, Dance whatever you like.
POSITIVE	In fact the nice thing about coming into med school with a major that’s not necessarily in the sciences is that you bring a level of diversity to the class.

NEUTRAL	What's up i wanted to do a video on the new teaser trailer that Activision released for what one can assume is the new Guitar Hero game.
NEUTRAL	I don't know if they are having a press event or it's just going to be a trailer that's going to be released like we saw with Rock Band 4 being announced.
NEGATIVE	A couple weeks back a couple of journalists posted that they got these invitations from Activision for what was called the Soundial festival.They had all these band names on it but none of the band names seemed familiar to anybody.
NEGATIVE	And a lot of people thought it was a new guitar hero being announced.
NEUTRAL	Personally i don't think we're going to see a more realistic guitar hero, i think the graphical style of the game maybe more realistic and more interactive but i think that Rocksmith has that section or at least that segment of the market covered with allowing people to learn real guitar, bass and do vocals as well.
POSITIVE	. But that's my thoughts on it and i'd like to know what you're guys thoughts are.
POSITIVE	I'm going to have all the information tomorrow probably in the afternoon or evening about when Guitar Hero is actually revealed and all the information we know about it.
NEUTRAL	And we've heard rumours in the past that the new guitar hero would be much more realistic in it's approach to the series.
POSITIVE	Maybe it could be something similar with what we've seen with Rocksmith with allowing people to play real guitars.

POSITIVE	I'm a professor here at Stanford and for the past eight years, I've been teaching the class "The Design and Analysis of Algorithms." And I'm pleased to say that for the first time we're going to be offering this class online, freely available to everybody.
POSITIVE	While the emphasis of the course is on timeless ideas and key principles.
NEUTRAL	On occasion, we'll also talk about applications, like for example, how the graph primitives that we learn are useful for reasoning about the web and social networks.
NEUTRAL	To maximize the benefit that you will derive from this class it will also include regular tools for self assessment, quizzes, and assignments.
POSITIVE	So in summary, when you study algorithms, it's a ton of fun because you wind up learning a lot of the greatest hits of from the last 50 years of computer science and I very much hope I'll see you in January.
POSITIVE	So here at Stanford, the design and analysis of algorithms is the corner stone of the computer sciences curriculum.
POSITIVE	Well, the ideas that you learn in this class are critical for literally every other branch of computer science and not only that also increasingly in the natural sciences in particular in computational biology and even in the social sciences, for example, in economics.
POSITIVE	On a more just purely pragmatic level, I have to say that every year when I teach this class several students come up to me afterwards and tell me it was the key class that got them to ace all of the questions in their mechanical interviews.
NEUTRAL	Well, we'll start out by talking about the divide and conquer algorithm design paradigm, in particular with applications to fast searching, sorting and multiplication.

NEUTRAL	So continuing with the bankruptcy theme I wanted to talk about some other brands that have filed for bankruptcy in the last few years
NEUTRAL	 One very notable one is American Apparel, especially since they've filed bankruptcy twice within the period of a little bit over a year
NEUTRAL	 But they're much more influenced now by the designer runways because of internet easy access to viewing collections online
NEUTRAL	 Teen trends used to be very isolated from runway trends but now with the rise of the internet and also access to cheap runway copies, any potential business for these outdated teen retailers has sort of been absorbed by companies like H&amp;M, Zara, Forever 21, and other online niche brands
POSITIVE	 The third thing is that social media celebrates diversity
NEUTRAL	 When I was a teenager there wasn't social media and it was much more common to just want to fit in, to look like your peers, to dress like your peers
NEUTRAL	 But today if you want to stand out online you have to be different and how many Instagram followers you have sort of overrides what your peers think of you
POSITIVE	 So if you are the kid in school that has the most followers out of that anyone else, then you probably are the cool kid in school because you have the biggest following you have the biggest influence
NEUTRAL	 And I think that you know it's sort of like just like the the value of sort of businesses, bloggers, and brands are sort of partly based off of the influence they have and how many followers they have teenagers acceptance among peers is also sort of based off of your influence your online influence
NEGATIVE	 And these troubled brands they just really didn't utilize this at least not fast enough
NEGATIVE	 That's kind of crazy
NEUTRAL	 Other brands include Pacific Sunwear, Cache, Wet Seal, and Quicksilver
NEUTRAL	 And if you kind of listen to the names of these brands you might figure out that there's a pattern
POSITIVE	 A lot of these are very teen specific or sort of focus on a younger customer
NEUTRAL	 I think there's sort of three big reasons why these types of companies are having trouble
NEUTRAL	 Number one is that trends are moving a lot quicker than they used to when I was a teenager
POSITIVE	 They're not as stagnant and there's been a huge acceleration over the past ten years of teen trends
NEUTRAL	 The second thing is that teen trends used to be a much more segregated niche
NEUTRAL	Okay we have talked about the person and the family in this birthday speech.

NEUTRAL	Any awards that they've won or raises or promotions or rushing up the corporate ladder.
NEUTRAL	VENKAT: I got interested in entrepreneurship and teaching entrepreneurship because of my experience that I had early in my career.
POSITIVE	Some of the most exciting times I've had were those two years when I worked for a spin-off of a large company, where we decided to start a new business.
POSITIVE	And after two years of that experience, I decided to come to the USA, get a PhD, and I decided to do it in the area of entrepreneurship.
POSITIVE	Darden was a natural home for me, because it's a place where not only can you practice and research and write what you believe in, what you feel strongly about, but it also put a lot of value on good teaching.
POSITIVE	And I read about entrepreneurs and the way they do things with my students.
POSITIVE	And so this is a natural and a perfect home for me to come and teach and practice the field of entrepreneurship.
POSITIVE	Because at the end of those two years, we had a beautiful product and we had many customers for that product.
POSITIVE	Hello, so today I'm going to speak to you about this product.
NEUTRAL	We keep each other safe, you know what I'm saying
NEGATIVE	But we can't because we -- you know, the system wants to divide and conquer so they find a way to do that

NEGATIVE	For far too long, the greatest predictor of how well you will do at school has been your parents' income.
NEUTRAL	If you're a teacher or a school governor and you're watching this video thinking about how much money this might mean for your school, it's really worth asking whether your school has done everything it can do to make sure that every child who's eligible for free school meals is actually registered to receive it.
NEUTRAL	Make sure you get the extra cash that your school needs because it will make a difference to working with those students and making sure they get the best opportunity in life.
POSITIVE	Every child deserves a chance, they deserve a chance to be the best that they can be and that's why the Government is introducing a pupil premium.
POSITIVE	Not only is it  increasing to £600 per pupil but also taking in many more students, reaching many more disadvantaged students who deserve that extra chance.
POSITIVE	The pupil premium is already making a big difference in schools.
POSITIVE	Schools are using it to pay for one-to-one tuition, extra catch-up classes,  parent support advisors, all the things we know make a difference for children who are falling behind.
NEGATIVE	It's simply not good enough that how well you should do at school is so dependent on your parents' background.
NEUTRAL	We have to break that cycle because of course how well you do at school will depend on how well you then go on to do in your job, how much you earn, how well you can support your family.
POSITIVE	Peter puts it out there in very plain language, and after you follow what he is doing there and you watch the stocks that he has provided over time you get a certain level of confidence ok, that Peter does know what he is doing!
POSITIVE	Um, in this case you don't have to invest too much you can start with just a small amount and then end up with double that which is great!
POSITIVE	The American Board of Internal Medicine, more often referred to as the ABIM, offers certification exams for all types of physicians and specialties, including Internal Medicine, Geriatric Medicine, and Transplant Hepatology.

NEUTRAL	There are 4 sessions in all, with each session lasting about 2 hours.
POSITIVE	Their website provides the best study guides, flash cards and practice tests around, so go check it out.
POSITIVE	You can also find links to these resources in the description below, or do a simple Google search for “Mometrix ABIM.” Thanks for watching, and good luck on your ABIM Certification exam!
POSITIVE	Well what the recession has shown us, and of course let's not forget that it's ongoing because there are still millions out of jobs and millions of homes being foreclosed, is that in order to bring readers and customers to your brand, you need to make sure they are engaged.
NEUTRAL	production, so if that doesn't interest you, you might not like this book

NEUTRAL	There are four exchanges used in the  counting method, and these exchanges  are similar, as I was saying earlier, to  borrowing in print.
NEUTRAL	The exchanges for  addition and multiplication are the  same and the exchanges for subtraction  and division are the same.
NEUTRAL	I’m going to explain how  these are used, and then we’re going  to talk about setting and reading  numbers on the abacus before we  start to talk about addition and  subtraction on the abacus.
NEUTRAL	If possible the exchanges of  the beads needs to occur in one movement as you count and move  the beads toward or away from the  horizontal counting bar.

NEUTRAL	Heck, I'm sure it's the bane of most businesses existence, especially those that deal with people who provide services and then pay at a later date.

NEUTRAL	Also provide them with the contact information for the person who originally secured your services.
NEUTRAL	If you're dealing with a particular client that's an individual or a family, make certain that you're dealing with them directly not providing the finished product until you've been paid, will minimize the likelihood that you're going to get paid late by any individual client.

POSITIVE	As always, a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea that while Asian women are sometimes portrayed in the media as desirable, we don’t really see a lot, if any, Asian men as objects of desire.
POSITIVE	He feels undesirable, in a way, because he identifies himself as Asian and he sees a lack of Asian men in the media as desirable.
NEGATIVE	Her family life isn’t too great, as her father abuses her mother and verbally abuses her.
NEGATIVE	And while there have been Asian men who have been action heroes, like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, they’re more viewed as weapons or comic relief, not necessarily as romantic love interests.

NEUTRAL	If you said "anata to aitakatta", you'd be saying something more, I think, like "I've been wanting us to get together, I've been wanting us to meet together
NEUTRAL	" There it's much more of a mutual idea, the idea that is there is activity going on on both sides of the interaction
NEUTRAL	In the causative form, as we discussed in the causative lesson, you can't use to at all

NEGATIVE	And the kind of investors that could become a liability on the company, are those that are either very bad in the way they manage the relationship with the founders.
NEUTRAL	Or they will demand all kind of terms that would basically take away either the control of the destiny of the company or slow down the company.
NEUTRAL	And so, when I see investors that are requiring extreme veto rights, or they're requiring to be the ones approving stuff, or investor I've even seen investor that say I want to sign on amounts of the company spends above a certain level.

NEUTRAL	Only then start thinking about who can help me the most and who can bring me the most value.
NEUTRAL	And then, when you think about who can bring me the most value, it's important to not think about who brings me the most value hands on, because you don't want your investors to be hands on with the business that you're building.
NEUTRAL	In between getting a great investor in three months, or getting a good investor now, go for the good investor now.
NEUTRAL	It's two things, is who gives me the most credibility in the market.
POSITIVE	Because let's say that you're building an open table like business, and if you've got an investor which is an open table x executive that brings you lots of credibility with investors.
POSITIVE	And then fulfill the rest of your needs in terms of people that will help you through advisors or anything else.

NEUTRAL	Compared to traditional fuels, shale gas has recently been touted as a low-cost, carbon-friendly alternative.
POSITIVE	This is the big reason why thirty-two bit versus sixty-four bit is such a big deal.
NEUTRAL	Programs were written originally with a thirty-two-bit limitation.
POSITIVE	By opening up the RAM from thirty-two bits to  sixty-four bits, the RAM goes from four gigabytes into the petabyte range, I mean it's just vast beyond words to describe, which means probably by next week we'll figure out a way to fill it up     but the fact is, Final Cut needs to have it's software actually recoded, rewritten to be able to support   the additional RAM that you've got.
NEUTRAL	So the reason you're getting an "out of memory" is that you're filling that four gigabyte limit.
NEUTRAL	The "out of memory" flag exists because your Browser is so full of stuff, either clips or sequences, and probably sequences, that is filling that two point five gigabyte limit to the point where Final Cut can't function.
NEUTRAL	The way you solve this problem is to get rid of clips in the Browser and get rid of sequences in the Browser that you no longer  need.
POSITIVE	The easiest way, because I know people say, "Wait a minute, I may need it." So make a backup of your file and the backup has all the stuff that you may need, but then you take out everything in the Browser for your current project so you slim that down.
NEUTRAL	There's another good point, nobody asked about this, but I want to re-stress this because I got called into  Sony Pictures   on Christmas Eve, because they were doing an edit and all of a sudden the edit was blowing up.
NEUTRAL	Sandra writes, "I have twelve GB of system memory, yet when I'm working on a complex project  FCP will give me out of memory flags.
NEUTRAL	As your project file goes over a hundred megabytes, I'm not exactly sure why that's true, but it is, it starts to become unstable and when it becomes unstable, it starts to corrupt and when it corrupts,  suddenly you're going to lose everything.
NEUTRAL	  If your project size ever gets close to a hundred megabytes, do everything you can to reduce, take out sequences you don't need, take out clips you don't need, and you're gonna see that Final Cut starts to get really peppy.
NEUTRAL	Final Cut's ability to handle really really complex systems, really complex projects, is limited by the fact that all of it's clips have to be stored in RAM.
NEUTRAL	And so to that end, you want to try to keep your Browser as clean as you can, and definitely keep an eye on your  project size.
NEGATIVE	This is especially frustrating when I have sent the project to compressor and I've already spent an hour processing I  get the failed response.
NEUTRAL	My life is over, I'm going to start walking in front of large moving buses." Phew, wow, that's a lot of responsibility.
NEUTRAL	Sandra, the fact that you've got twelve gigabytes of ram on your system does not mean Final Cut takes advantage of it.
NEUTRAL	In fact, having RAM on your computer is only  part of the equation.
NEUTRAL	Once the RAM is there, the programmers need to write  the program to take advantage of the extra RAM.
NEGATIVE	There are three distinct reasons why you may not be seeing your ads.

POSITIVE	Stay tuned to our next video where I'll be giving an in-depth description of the ad preview tool and the keyword preview tool, so you too can view your ads like a pro.
NEUTRAL	The second is a budgetary and billing concern, and the third is your actual selection of delivery methods.
NEUTRAL	Budgetary and billing concerns are often the most overlooked reasons as to why your ads are not delivering.
NEUTRAL	In AdWords, daily and monthly budgets are set to reflect what you would like to see from your campaign spend.
NEUTRAL	If your daily or monthly budget has been depleted your ads will no longer show as it's simply a factor of the click costs you can accrue within your budget.
NEUTRAL	It's possible that there is an issue with the method of payment, an outstanding balance, or something that's causing the credit card to not process.
NEUTRAL	This is a definite reason why your ads will not be showing.

POSITIVE	Now that's not necessarily bad, especially if you're a fan of the scents of Axe and you plan to wear a body scent after.
POSITIVE	This could be your primary scent to wear after you go to the gym or something.
POSITIVE	It definitely, it worked.
NEUTRAL	I am the co-founder of Malestandard.com, and today I am excited because I have another product to review for you guys.
POSITIVE	I'm not an overly sweaty person, but I did feel dry, and when I wore this product I did not wear any other fragrances with it.
POSITIVE	And I got a lot of good compliments actually from it.
POSITIVE	One definitely from my girlfriend, and it's not just because she's my girlfriend because I have tried other products and have not had favorable results sometimes.
POSITIVE	So this is definitely something good.
POSITIVE	But what really excited me was the campaign that they told us about.
POSITIVE	Now if you go to Wal-Mart and you purchase a package of specially marked Apollo Axe, you'll find a code.
POSITIVE	With that code, you'll be able to go to a special website and the link is going to be at the bottom of this YouTube video, and it'll also be on malestandard.com, and you enter the code.
POSITIVE	If you select a winning package, you could win a trip to space.
POSITIVE	I mean, how many of you have seen those commercials from Axe where it's showing the astronaut and the girl's going all crazy for the astronaut?
POSITIVE	That could be you if you enter the code, if you purchase the right product.
NEUTRAL	This time, the good folks over at Axe have asked us to review their new Apollo line.
NEUTRAL	So overall, for an Axe product, we definitely dug it.
NEUTRAL	We've tried different Axe products and I'd say this is our favorite so far, especially the scent.
NEUTRAL	The Fresh scent is really good.
POSITIVE	And the opportunity to go into space is awesome.
POSITIVE	So we will be posting this video on Malestandard.com with a more in-depth written review and the link to sign up for the Apollo space camp.

NEUTRAL	So I have the shampoo and conditioner here and I have the new deodorant here.
POSITIVE	So in Male Standard fashion, the first thing we did was we looked at the shampoo and conditioner and we examined the scent.
POSITIVE	Now what I have here is the Fresh scent.
NEUTRAL	And if you've seen reviews in the past or read the reviews on our website, you'll see that we are big fans of subtle scents when it comes to shampoos and conditioners or body washes.
NEUTRAL	Now the main reason is because a lot of us like to wear cologne at night.
POSITIVE	So if you have a really overpowering scent, it will clash and just create something that's really not what we wanted.
NEUTRAL	If neither the dictator nor the terrorists are the answer – and they are not – our challenge is to create conditions under which a clear and broadly acceptable alternative can emerge.
NEGATIVE	And over the last month, he has directed every member of his national security team to pick up the pace and move forward with ideas for degrading and defeating Daesh more rapidly, more completely, and permanently.
POSITIVE	Second, we are intensifying our diplomatic effort to finally bring an end to the civil war in Syria.
POSITIVE	The more progress we make on one, the more likely we are to succeed on the others.
NEUTRAL	This is a case, and there are many in history, in which two supposed enemies are in fact symbolic.
NEGATIVE	Loathing towards Assad drove thousands of Syrians into the arms of Daesh.
NEGATIVE	And fear of Daesh caused some Syrian groups to feel that they had no realistic option but to support the government.
NEUTRAL	That’s not just symbolic; that’s a symbiotic relationship, each piece dependent on the other.
NEUTRAL	The relationship between Assad and Daesh clarifies one of the apparent peculiarities of this conflict – that the two extremes have only rarely targeted one another.
NEUTRAL	Republicans have been at the heart and soul of environmental issues.
POSITIVE	I think one of the best ways to talk about what it means to be a republican is to take people that republicans best identify as the leaders who are republicans.
POSITIVE	We go back to Abraham Lincoln, we like to talk about Teddy Roosevelt, we like to talk about Eisenhower and we like to talk about Ronald Reagan.
NEUTRAL	Now why do I say that
NEUTRAL	I don’t think doctors should be accountable for their actions
POSITIVE	In fact, I think they’re heroes, no matter what they do
POSITIVE	Financial aid is available for international students .We do expect that the international students will notify us if they do intend to apply for financial aid at the time that they submit their admission application.
NEUTRAL	Work study is set at a maximum of 2100 dollars, so it is not a vehicle that should be used to manage the family contribution really nor is it meant for students to be sending home.
NEUTRAL	“— +,ù®0 0 h p ˜ &nbsp; ¨ ° ¸ À È Ð ä Mount Holyoke College ' 6 Is financial aid available for international students Title þÿÿÿ þÿÿÿ þÿÿÿ ! " # þÿÿÿ% &amp; ' ( ) * + þÿÿÿýÿÿÿ.
NEUTRAL	And we do want all financial aid forms to be submitted at the same time that the admission application is submitted.
NEUTRAL	A loan would be something that has to be paid back once the student leaves school and work study would be work on campus during the academic year.
POSITIVE	Students might also-domestic students and international students are also working on campus in the summer and they sometimes work during J term or during holiday breaks as well.
POSITIVE	On Wednesday the major index tracking exchange traded funds edged lower.
NEUTRAL	Despite the cautious mood in the markets overall, SPDR S&amp;P Bank ETF rose modestly in early trade.
NEUTRAL	Retail earnings did very little for consumer discretionary exchange traded funds.
NEGATIVE	Retail earnings from Home Depot and Lowe's have disappointed investors.
NEUTRAL	In other ETF market news, investors have turned bearish on U.S.
NEUTRAL	And my group is basically doing it on natural water filters using plants to purify water, which is basically a natural way to get rid of carcinogens in the water supply for people and underdeveloped countries can get access to clean water more efficiently than  paying so much money for all the devices or just like... not having water at all.
POSITIVE	This year nearly 300,000 Americans will study somewhere outside our borders and nearly 1 million students will come to the United States for a world-class education.
POSITIVE	Even in an age when we can take a virtual trip to far-flung places just by clicking a mouse, we still want to see the world for ourselves and discover our common bonds first-hand.
POSITIVE	That's why we created the Fulbright Program in 1946. Today it is stronger than ever with thousands of scholars traveling to and from over 150 countries.
POSITIVE	For those of you already pursuing an education abroad I'm very grateful and wish you well.

POSITIVE	And to those students who have yet to study abroad I urge you to stretch your boundaries and your imaginations and set off on your own adventures.
NEUTRAL	PwC will become the first firm to offer places under the new professional services Higher Apprenticeship framework.
POSITIVE	The two year tax Apprenticeship is based on the new, government sponsored professional services Higher Apprenticeship framework that PwC's own consulting practice has developed with employers and professional bodies, and which is expected to be formally endorsed by Government in the near future.
NEUTRAL	By doing a formal Apprenticeship, people can take an accredited route to a highly skilled career in professional services within a nationally recognized framework.
NEGATIVE	In developed economies the youth unemployment rate will decline in the next 5 years, from the current 17.5% to 15.6% in 2017. This decline is mainly related to the fact that increasingly young people are dropping out of the labour market, as they find it more and more difficult to find a job.
NEUTRAL	Young people dropping out of the labour market are actually not counted anymore as unemployed, as they are inactive.
NEUTRAL	What they often do is staying at home, until the times get better.
NEUTRAL	Given the circumstances, they are likely to take up informal activities.
NEGATIVE	But so far, from a statistical point of view, we are basically not counting them anymore as job seekers, because they have dropped out.
NEUTRAL	“Once I learned everything that Ms
POSITIVE	Barber could offer, and how responsive her girls are to her and the needs of the team, it’s been an incredible fit the last couple years
POSITIVE	” “Behind the scenes we do so much that people don’t actually know, when people realize it they’re like, Wow you guys do a lot
POSITIVE	Whenever the team reports we’re here 30 minutes prior to them, getting things ready

NEUTRAL	“A lot of times when football practice is going on there’s other home events
POSITIVE	So they’re out at every practice, so they’re kind of an extra set of eyes for me, they’re great, they give me a call, so and so’s down, so and so needs help
NEUTRAL	What do you want me to do to get the process started
NEUTRAL	We produce a huge quantity of waste every year
NEUTRAL	 And this waste we throw away for good
NEUTRAL	 What we want to do with the circular economy is to recycle waste to obtain raw materials, and also make sure that products are designed to last and can be reused and recycled, in order to have a higher value in their entire life cycle
NEUTRAL	 It is clear that if we raise our recycling targets and we create the conditions for a high quality recycling system, we will obtain raw materials that instead of ending up in a landfill enter the cycle, the market
NEUTRAL	 This means that waste has a value, the waste is not a burden anymore but becomes an economic asset
NEUTRAL	 If it is an economic asset, it means that we will pay more attention to it, both when we recycle at home and and also when companies begin their manufacturing process
NEUTRAL	Today, we're going to ask the question how do insurance companies meser, measure risk?
NEUTRAL	Sometimes it's high, sometimes it's low based upon the odds.

POSITIVE	NOW HE HAS ALMOST SWUNG ME AND BECOME ALMOST AN AMERICAN HERO
POSITIVE	THE SECOND PART IS WHY THIS IS A REALLY ADJUSTING STORY TODAY
NEUTRAL	IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW FOOTBALL, THE SEAHAWKS AND THE 49'ERS HATE EACH OTHER
NEUTRAL	Our recipients of those microloans, they do not use those loans efficiently.
NEUTRAL	And so the idea is if you provide training, basic business training, to those loan recipients say it would, you know, it would improve their well-being.
NEUTRAL	So basically, there are many different training programs; and when you start studying the effect of those programs, you find it often the fact is actually negative like on special or something such as profitability or no effect on things such as consumption.
NEGATIVE	It seems that programs do more bad than good, which is really counterintuitive and surprising.
NEGATIVE	I developed a theoretical framework trying to explain how, you know, efficient let’s say programs that’s supposed to improve profit and ends up actually hurting microloan recipients and they end up with lower profit.
POSITIVE	So what we’re doing is recommending to our clients political as well as non profit as well as commercial what they should do in on line advertising.
NEUTRAL	And that’s where both our political and our commercial and non profit clients should be thinking about going.
NEUTRAL	The greatest piece of advice I can tell anybody who goes into a pawn shop is; check your attitude at the door.
NEGATIVE	We don't like to be rude with people but if we have to we will be.
NEUTRAL	You have to understand that this is a business and we're in the business of making money.
POSITIVE	[music] Jamie Gruman: I think the main strength of the program is that it can be completed in a reasonable amount of time, and you finish the program with very solid, strong research skills that allow into you to take those skills either into industry or into an academic job
POSITIVE	 Not only do you get a top-notch, research-based education, you get to build a connection with faculty that really take an interest in promoting your development
NEUTRAL	 My niche is really in organizational leadership but I work at the intersection of a couple of spheres
POSITIVE	 One, I work a lot with social entrepreneurship, which is something that deals with corporate social responsibility and how to do good in a way that actually creates good business value
NEUTRAL	 I also deal in the field of managing organizations and managing projects, so I look at that intersection with social entrepreneurship
POSITIVE	 And finally, I also look at high technology or information technology and how that impacts how we manage companies, how we manage information, and how we manage people
POSITIVE	 Jamie Gruman: A lot of the work that we do is very heavily applied, and so you can take the skills that you're gaining here and use them, either for an academic career or a career in the world of practice
NEUTRAL	 Ruben Burga: I've been able to go through academic conferences overseas, and also within Canada, to be able to present my research
NEUTRAL	 I've also been able to participate in award-winning papers that have resulted from different aspects of my research
POSITIVE	 My last two papers actually resulted from having participated in research that originated at the University
POSITIVE	 A co-author and myself sat together with our advisor and created some research that really delved into conceptually, how do students learn? That related back again to some of the research I was doing towards organizational leadership
POSITIVE	 Jamie Gruman: What I like the most about working with the PhD students is they're skilled and they're hungry
POSITIVE	 Ruben Burga: The students benefit from the interaction with the professors, and this interaction is in the hallway, it is not necessarily a formal interaction, but as you meet up with the professors you start getting a sense of what I should do in my case because they share ideas, or I share my ideas and they give me feedback
POSITIVE	 They want to learn
POSITIVE	 So the culture is very supportive
POSITIVE	 The culture is very dynamic
POSITIVE	 People are interested when you actually publish something, or when you present something, and it's always questioning the big why are you doing this
POSITIVE	 Now through the process of doing my own research I worked a lot with specific professors and advisors, and they helped to refine my thinking about where I wanted to go
POSITIVE	 Jamie Gruman: We've had students investigate a wide variety of issues, in the program
POSITIVE	 We've looked at IT project management, we've had students looking at accountability in public organizations, we've had students doing research on leadership in military organizations
POSITIVE	 One of my students is currently investigating the role of psychological capital, which is hope, optimism, confidence and resilience in entrepreneurship, and does psychological capital lead to more success among entrepreneurs? Ruben Burga: My research really focuses on project management and the management controls that are used by project managers to be able to create a successful project out of their existing projects
POSITIVE	Thank you so much for joining me today on our healthy version of how to do snacks right.
NEUTRAL	And, the other tip: clean out the pantry from all the bad stuff.
NEGATIVE	No matter how much healthy stuff you put in the pantry, if you don't take the bad stuff out, it's still going to tempt you.
NEUTRAL	Just take it out of the equation all together so it won't even be there as a temptation.
POSITIVE	I have my yam chips, and you'll see it's a very small amount because I keep eating them.
POSITIVE	Again, the two tips that I really encourage you to invest some time in: plan and prepare, that may mean some cooking at home.
NEUTRAL	But, even if it means you are not making your own nut/trailmix, go buy some.
NEUTRAL	G'Day I just saw Godzilla in 3D and I left the Cinema a bit disappointed but not get me wrong I am still giving this movie let me start with the good things when Godzilla is shown full screen first time and roar it really made you tremble , shake ! it is awesome, Bryan Cranston with the little screen time that he gets, it is very good!

NEUTRAL	Ladies you are primarily going to be wearing business suits or definitely skirts, hose, high heeled shoes, but probably rarely ever slacks, unless you're wearing a pant suit.
NEUTRAL	Before we started working with CENTORRINO Technologies we had a local firm that worked with us
NEUTRAL	 Same gentleman most of the time came
NEUTRAL	 And now everything is backed up offsite by CENTORRINO Technologies and we don't have to worry about it and I know that it is there because we have had to retrieve it before
POSITIVE	 So what we get with CENTORRINO Technologies is an overall package
POSITIVE	 We pay a fixed fee and we get unlimited support - that's phone support, people coming down to work on our system or email support
POSITIVE	 It means that we can look to the future as well and bring on new systems or new products and they are going to be able to service those
NEUTRAL	 We added some iPads earlier this year and they are going to be managing those for us into the future
POSITIVE	 It just means that we can bring our technology forward without having to worry about knowing how to manage it
NEUTRAL	 We've got Mac and PCs here
POSITIVE	 We are leaning towards more of a Mac school and that's been something that has been a real bonus for us
POSITIVE	 Having someone from CENTORRINO Technologies who understands Macs
POSITIVE	 We had a lot of trouble in the beginning to get that to happen but now that we've got someone who comes down here regularly to work on those
NEUTRAL	 It was a little limiting
NEUTRAL	 It just meant they are a lot easier to run
NEUTRAL	 For teachers and students it really again means that they can most of the time be sure if our network is up because everything is working properly - that they can just run their day
POSITIVE	 Teachers can just come to school, know that if they want to run a YouTube clip for the children first thing in the morning, that it is going to work
POSITIVE	 That if they want to connect up to their interactive whiteboard that they know that its going to work
POSITIVE	 The children when they are sent off to use the iPads or the computers know that they are going to work
POSITIVE	 And that's what makes teaching so much easier
POSITIVE	 And from my perspective as an administrator, I'm also the IT person here it means that I am not running around trying to fix things, because they just work
POSITIVE	 Yes, I will recommend CENTORRINO Technologies and have in the past recommended them
POSITIVE	 I believe that they have the ability to know what the needs of our schools are
NEUTRAL	 He didn't have a knowledge of how the CEO worked and what the requirements were
NEUTRAL	 And so we just found that he just couldn't service us the way we needed to
NEUTRAL	 We found out about CENTORRINO Technologies through a couple of other schools, one in Torquay who were using CENTORRINO Technologies at the time and another one up in the western area
NEUTRAL	 They were using CENTORRINO as well and had good reports back about those so we thought we'd have a chat
POSITIVE	 What CENTORRINO Technologies have done for us is really been able to give us surety in how our system works
NEUTRAL	 Before CENTORRINO Technologies I had to go down to the server every night before I left and throw another tape into back it up and take these with me and it was often you would forget those sort of things
POSITIVE	 It was always a constant worry that it wasn't actually working
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately, no one has really come up with a much better idea.
NEGATIVE	Frankly, we see this kind of – these kinds of attacks as an act or acts of desperation by Daesh, targeting Baghdad as they are to sow fear after it’s been largely forced out of Ramadi.
POSITIVE	I also want to note the bravery of the Iraqi security forces who responded to this weekend’s attacks.
NEUTRAL	Of course, we extend our deepest condolences to all the families and all those affected by this senseless violence, and we reaffirm our commitment to support the Iraqi people and the Government of Iraq as they work to defeat Daesh.
POSITIVE	Hope you had a lot of fun working with the Pirate Fleet app.
POSITIVE	It is my first presidential inauguration that I'm watching so I think it was just a really great opportunity that Student Affairs was putting on so that the students and campus has a place to watch it.
POSITIVE	I grew up Republican, but I think it is a big day in history today and I don't think it matters what party the president is and I think we need change, we need the economy to pick up, we need the world to be a better place and if Obama is going to be the one to do it, then I'm all for it.
NEUTRAL	That works your chest and your back, Lacey confirmed
NEUTRAL	your core, firmly place your hands down on the table top and twist from side to side until you start to feel the burn before your next meeting
NEUTRAL	You can even optimize that wait on the printing queue by standing and doing leg lifts, then going up and down on your toes to work your calves
NEUTRAL	All of these exercises are jean friendly and guarantee getting in some fitness time even on work hours
POSITIVE	This is not only better for your body, but also for your mind and morale
NEUTRAL	As always, make sure that you take advantage of the great opportunity to create a very strong dialog with   your instructor.
POSITIVE	I'm sure you will make great friends with the   fellow students just as you would on-campus.
POSITIVE	On behalf of the staff, faculty and administration, we   appreciate your interest in Gateway Technical College.
POSITIVE	We know you have many choices in choosing your   college and we thank you for selecting Gateway.

POSITIVE	 It's run by a fantastic team of professors; they are always available for you
POSITIVE	 They've got your interests at heart
POSITIVE	 They want this program to succeed, they want you to succeed so it's, it's been a fantastic experience so far
POSITIVE	 One of the best things about it is that while Philisophy doesn't seem like it's applicable to real life situations, everything that you learn in this program, you use on a day-to-day basis
POSITIVE	 And it's great because you can use it in any kind of future endeavor
POSITIVE	When this jar is full or it's half-filled or three quarters filled, I take the contents from here and I put them inside a business card binder that I made.
POSITIVE	This is just a regular two-inch binder that I got from Staples.
POSITIVE	And what I did was I got these A through Z color-coded dividers and I file all my business cards with the name of the company.
NEUTRAL	So if the name of your company begins with A, I'm going to file your card in the A section.
POSITIVE	And I'm going to use these business card sheets that are again, available at Staples.
NEUTRAL	So if it's a floral company, you would file the card under F for flowers.
POSITIVE	It makes sense for me to do it by company so that's why I do it that way.
POSITIVE	But when you are done, you have this great business card binder that is going to be really easy to just flip through and find the exact card when you need it.
POSITIVE	Your kids don't want to play with Joe Smith, the plumber's business card.
POSITIVE	So it's time to gather all those cards that don't belong in the places where they're currently at and put them in a system that is going to be easy to put away, easy to find, and easy to grab when it's time to look for that card to contact that person that you've been meaning to contact for months.
POSITIVE	I've been a clinical aesthetician for over half a decade, and I'm going to talk to you about whether or not hemorrhoidal cream can help wrinkles.
NEUTRAL	My name is Keeley Selvage with Keeley's Skin Solutions and that is whether or not hemorrhoidal cream will help your wrinkles.
POSITIVE	The reason it works so well is because most have steroids in them.
NEGATIVE	This can be very dangerous for our face, and it will actually even show dark circles, and imperfections, scars, even more prevalently than they would have before.
NEGATIVE	Also when your face absorbs it, your body absorbs it and it can be dangerous for your whole body.

NEUTRAL	 They are not the cheapest option on the market when it comes to monitoring, but we feel that they have a really great overall value
POSITIVE	 So if you're okay with paying just a tiny bit more, but getting great customer service and a great customer experience, we think you'll really like them
POSITIVE	 So we've talked about it throughout the entire review, but honestly what sets Frontpoint apart is customer service
NEUTRAL	 So we've actually done quite a few phone calls that were mystery shopping Frontpoint - making sure that we understood how they treat their customers when it comes to tough issues or complaints or sales
POSITIVE	 And we were really impressed by how much time they were willing to take, by how patient they were and how little pressure there was during the sales process
NEUTRAL	 It was focused around answering questions instead of trying to up-sell us home automation or an extra camera
POSITIVE	 Frontpoint uses a combination of cutting edge technology, equipment and customer service all at a great price
POSITIVE	 It's a really hard combination to beat, and for the last 9 years, nobody has
POSITIVE	 Frontpoint is actually been our #1 pick for 9 years running
POSITIVE	 And this is primarily due to their incredibly high levels of customer service and the way that they handle their sales process - it's a lot lower pressure than some of the other companies out there
NEUTRAL	 We're going to do a deep dive and go into what really sets Frontpoint apart from it's competitors and what you're going to get if you do decide to go with Frontpoint
POSITIVE	 Frontpoint Security Systems are both 100% wireless -meaning that the sensors in your home all wirelessly communicate to your control panel - as well as 100% cellular monitoring - which means that a burglar can't cut your phone line and bypass the security system
NEUTRAL	 If you're in a very rural area you may or may not be able to get monitoring service where you live so just make sure to call and check with Frontpoint
POSITIVE	 Unlike some other companies, Frontpoint has done a really great job of being transparent with their pricing and their fees

NEUTRAL	 They also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee which will allow you to test out the sensors and the system in your home
NEUTRAL	They differ from the articles of incorporation generally in that they are not filed with the secretary of state's office in the state in which the corporation is incorporated.

NEUTRAL	And it's a retirement future that can ultimately turned in to an income for you when you no longer have an income and you're fully retired.
NEGATIVE	Many people are not until they get to be a older age and they realize that gosh they wasted a lot of time and money in placing bets on stock that's ultimately lost value.
NEUTRAL	So the answer to the question, can I contribute stock to an IRA is absolutely correct but always be mindful of the security that your using it, make sure it's safe.
POSITIVE	is, you can say, hey I really like baby skin, they are so soft, they don’t have any hair on their face
POSITIVE	It’s so nice, by giving a good example and not directly comparing it to a lady
NEUTRAL	You are hinting that you want her to remove her mustache
POSITIVE	And lastly, hey or hey bitch
NEUTRAL	I’ve seen this in US or in the US

NEUTRAL	I mentioned a word in the last clip called 'monotone', and I want to talk about that briefly.
NEUTRAL	Now, the big problem with being monotone, obviously, you'll put your audience to sleep.
NEUTRAL	What monotone is, is it means that you use only one pitch in your voice, so that everything sounds exactly the same.
POSITIVE	Three pitches, two pitches, always better than one which will leave you monotone.
POSITIVE	And I think that feeling of empowerment is much more valuable than the feeling you get on television.

NEUTRAL	going to get married or are already married
NEUTRAL	I think finances for some reason has been a very delicate issue between couples

NEUTRAL	It comes from the Palestinian education system, which is controlled by the Palestinian Authority.
NEGATIVE	Yesterday Eliav Gelman lost his life in another terrorist attack, not by the students of terrorism, but by those who teach terrorism, a Palestinian teacher.

NEUTRAL	It's really designed for well water because that's the kind of water that typically will have an iron problem.
NEUTRAL	Rust Out is a water softener resin cleaner, specifically designed for well water, or water that is iron bearing.
NEUTRAL	It's commonly the culprit behind those nasty iron stains in your toilet bowls, or in your tub or even in your laundry sometimes.
NEUTRAL	And if your softener is working properly and you have low levels of iron, your softener should be able to handle it.
NEUTRAL	But what happens is, the softener resin does not want to fully let go of all of the iron that it captures, and the resin becomes fouled.

NEGATIVE	Shiva, "that we are being treated like a waste dump
POSITIVE	" I said, "Yes, we are
NEUTRAL	" And it led to a huge series of investigations and a new alertness
NEUTRAL	And what's basically happening is in countries like the US, the waste isn't thrown by every consumer everywhere

NEUTRAL	Education, health care, all these critical if not dealt with and kept to the last, will turn India into less of a superpower than it can be.

NEGATIVE	 But who knows? I (umm) am probably tougher on movies than a lot of people
POSITIVE	 This was pretty popular (umm) and it's a good choice for like I said kids or families
POSITIVE	 (umm) So if you're looking for something it's sort of lighthearted
NEUTRAL	 (umm) It's only PG
NEUTRAL	 Cheaper by the Dozen is a good place to look

NEGATIVE	 I didn't really like the movie, I thought it was cheesy
NEGATIVE	 I think Steve Martin's done other better things
NEGATIVE	 Ebert and Roper apparently said two thumbs up here on the cover but for me it's probably two thumbs down

NEUTRAL	This is my review of a movie currently in theaters and that movie being Evan Almighty
NEUTRAL	 I was a huge fan of the original film Bruce Almighty but I did think it was funny
NEGATIVE	 There's definitely better ways to go about humor than making you know really unfunny jokes, and there's a lot of moments like that
NEGATIVE	 The story sucks, the characters were really wooden and plain and I liked some of the actors and actresses, so I'm not sure what was going on there
NEGATIVE	 It just seems like a really lousy effort by everybody and (uhh) I guess the box office is reflecting that
NEGATIVE	 Unfortunately, it seems like it'll be a good bomb
POSITIVE	 Like Jim Carey, Morgan Freeman and I like Steve Carell too so I figured okay you know the sequel will be pretty good
NEUTRAL	 Then I heard that it was gonna have like a, it was going way over budget, it was going to be two-hundred and fifty million
NEUTRAL	 Then I was thinking I don't know how a comedy can really be two-hundred fifty million but you know, I guess with all this hype it's worth seeing
NEGATIVE	 And I'm afraid it wasn't
NEGATIVE	 (umm) All the money they seem to have spent on a giant arc and a bunch of live animals
NEGATIVE	 There seems to be a ton of CG but there also seems to be a ton of real animals and I'm not sure why they would have blown all that money when they could have just you know CG's it all, because the animals really weren't that impressive
NEUTRAL	 It's definitely geared towards kids, the story isn't as well done, as Bruce Almighty, seems to have targeted even a younger crowd
NEGATIVE	 Like, I mean there's a lot of animal poop jokes in there that really didn't need to be there
NEUTRAL	My children and I recently went to see the movie Surf's Up
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I was very disappointed in it

NEUTRAL	 (umm) I've had my fill of it
NEGATIVE	 So, I would highly recommend that you save your money
NEUTRAL	 It (uhh) was a commentary

NEUTRAL	 And it's about the four boys trying to save (umm), some sort of Armageddon between us and Canada
NEUTRAL	 It's an animated film, probably about an hour and a half, maybe two hours long
NEGATIVE	 It's, (umm) as I said I don't like it, I'd give it about a two
NEGATIVE	 It's not appropriate for kids because there's a lot of cursing and things in it

NEGATIVE	 And It felt like the you know there's like just a little bit just way too typical of a boring film that tries really hard to be funny but it's just not funny at all and it's not it's not (stutter) witty
NEGATIVE	 It it's (stutter) not even romantic you know in a way that, the way it's written it's like how can someone you know go that hard
NEGATIVE	 It's just like at the end when you're done with the movie you don't even believe in the original premise of the movie
NEGATIVE	 You don't believe that someone can actually you know believe in the priest and just wanted get married that badly in that church

NEGATIVE	 Even the robotic baby part was supposed to be funny, it didn't turn out to be funny in the film
NEGATIVE	 It looked funny in the clip for the trailer but didn't seem funny at all
NEGATIVE	 And (umm) you know Mandy Moore's character is kind of like, you feel like her character's unrealistic because what type of girl would go that hard core to you know to get married in this church and it just seemed unrealistic and she gets all in a hissy fit and it's just really really tiring and stressful movie

NEGATIVE	I recently viewed the movie Click with Adam Sandler, and I was very disappointed
NEGATIVE	 I expected more, I'd seen the previews and I thought it looked like a pretty good story
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It's PG-thirteen, but in this day and age, PG-thirteen it's harder to tell what, what that really means, you know, well in this one there's lots of cussing, (umm) there's some bedroom scenes, even though they don't show any skin you obviously know what they're doing
NEGATIVE	 (umm) There's (uhh) a dog that keeps (uhh) humping the stuffed animal, there's farting, I just I just (stutter) thought it was a rude movie
POSITIVE	 I loved the storyline
POSITIVE	 You know, I love the fact of what the story about, in fact in even made me cry in the end
NEGATIVE	 But we could've done without all the other garbage that they added to this movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I don't know why they do that to movies, and my husband was very leery of it too, because he said I've never seen an Adam Sandler movie that's actually been clean and (umm) and actually okay for children to watch
NEGATIVE	 So I'm gonna give this a two just because you know, it could (stutter) it had so much potential, and they just like, trashed it up in my opinion
NEUTRAL	I just watched (uhh) this movie, Happily N'Ever After
NEUTRAL	 I was looking very forward to seeing it when I had remembered seeing the previews for it

NEUTRAL	 Not much else I can say about it

NEGATIVE	 However, I started watching it with my kids and they got so bored they got up and left, went outside to play

POSITIVE	 My name is Jordan and today I will be reviewing the movie Ratatouille
POSITIVE	 (umm) I think that (uhh) a lot of the more recent videos from Disney such as The Emperor's New Groove, (umm) Over the Hedge, and stuff like that, they've had a lot of real high brow (umm) you know adult comedy but, I think Ratatouille does a very good job in (umm) sticking to it's target audience which is kids and you know, hyping that to how Disney movies used to be, you know, with with kids jokes and not these kinds of inane sexual references so I would highly recommend Ratatouille
POSITIVE	 I think it's a great movie that anyone should see

NEGATIVE	 (uhh) I know that (umm) in Finding Nemo they had, in fact, (uhh) made the scenes look too real so they had to, you know, kind of fake it down and I'm pretty sure they did the same thing in Ratatouille
POSITIVE	 (umm) I cook a lot {laughter} and so I can appreciate, you know, a lot of the (uhh) a lot of the food references that are made
POSITIVE	 (umm) I I (stutter) love the storyline, it's so incredible, it's like anyone can cook

POSITIVE	 I think I think (stutter) it's incredible
NEUTRAL	This is a review of John Lamaro's Land of the Dead

POSITIVE	This helped give me the experience and qualifications I needed to make me competitive in the job market.

NEGATIVE	 I didn't like it
NEGATIVE	 It was kind of (umm) more funny to me than it was scary
NEGATIVE	 I kind of took the whole thing as a joke
NEUTRAL	 But (uhh) it's definitely in the vein of, like, I don't know, I'd I'd (stutter) say it's pretty similar, in some aspects, to a movie like (umm) maybe even, maybe Saw
NEGATIVE	 It's almost (umm), I don't know, it's almost too similar, to the point of where you kind of know what's going to happen, kind of all all (stutter) those kind of movies kind of blend together
NEGATIVE	 But, I mean, if you're going to watch a movie like that, go see Saw again or something, because this movie is really not good at all
NEUTRAL	Hi, I'm Bruce and today (umm) I'm reviewing the DVD (uhh) widescreen edition of Premonition, (uhh) starring Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon, and here's a closer look at it
NEUTRAL	 I don't have the box for it because I rented it (uhh) at (uhh) Red Box, one of their kiosks
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) But it, and that's a long movie to me
NEGATIVE	 But it felt (uhh) at least like three hours and the fact that they kept rewinding the story where she keeps reliving the same week over and over, (uhh) it felt extremely long (uhh) and (uhh) it just really went on a long time
NEUTRAL	 And this is a psychological thriller
NEUTRAL	 It's rated PG-thirteen, (uhh) and again starring Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon and the (uhh) movie is about a woman who's forced to perpetually relive a terrible week in her life (uhh) where her husband is killed in a car crash

NEUTRAL	Hi
NEUTRAL	 Today I'd like review Die Another Day, the James Bond movie starring Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry
NEGATIVE	 And this is one of the more recent James Bond movies but I found that it's just really silly overall
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I mean it has some entertaining action sequences, some cool gadgets and cars and stuff, but overall it just feels tired and old and not that engaging
POSITIVE	 (umm) The DVD however is quite good
NEUTRAL	 It's, this is the two disc ultimate edition DVD, part of the James Bond ultimate edition set, and (umm) has several features on the two discs it comes in
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Like audio commentary, (umm) lots of featurettes and documentaries, interactive things you can do
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) Trailers, DVD-rom features, (umm) great audio and video quality so it's got a lot of features and it's generally a great DVD set but the movie's not really that good so I (stutter) don't think I'll recommend it
NEUTRAL	Hey guys, my name is Emma and I'm here to talk to you about a movie I saw recently, Spider Man Three
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I gotta say I've seen the other two Spider Man movies and I wasn't really that impressed, you know
NEGATIVE	 They're pretty entertaining I guess and I'm a fan of (uhh) Kirsten Dunst so I always like to watch movies that she's in but I didn't have high expectations for Spider Man Three because I didn't really like the first two, but it certainly did not exceed my incredibly low expectations
NEGATIVE	 You know, it was probably worse than I thought it would be, actually
NEGATIVE	 Granted I only paid two dollars to see it, (uhh) there's a really cheap movie theater where I live that I can go see movies that have come out (umm) recently for pretty cheap but two dollars didn't even really seem like a bargain considering that movie, you know? Just really cheesy (uhh) the graphics and stuff were just kind of annoying, like the CGI stuff
NEGATIVE	 I don't know, I'm not really into that, and the action in it was really not that exciting
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The acting also horrible, you know, I realize it's based on a comic book and that's kind of the style that they're in, you know, kind of over the top, kind of cheesy, but I don't know
NEGATIVE	 I feel like there's a lot of movies that have come out recently based on comic books that are way better than the Spider Man ones and it's just kind of a disappointment
NEGATIVE	 I think that they could have done a much better job on that movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) So in a scale from like one to five I think I'd give it like a two, honestly
NEUTRAL	Hi, this is my review of Jurassic Park Three
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) This is the third Jurassic Park, obviously, in the series and unlike the previous two it is not directed by Steven Spielberg
NEGATIVE	 I don't think it was needed at all and I didn't really enjoy it
NEGATIVE	 I actually found it pretty hard to sit through
NEGATIVE	 So (uhh) I definitely will not recommend this movie
NEGATIVE	 I would say you could skip it entirely even if you were a fan of the previous movies
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) So unfortunately (uhh) a great series that really just lived on longer than I think it needed to
NEUTRAL	 He does executive produce, but it is (uhh) directed by Joe Johnston
POSITIVE	 (umm) What I found most exciting about this movie when I first heard about that they were making a third is that it once again stars Sam Neill who was absent in the second movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Unfortunately (uhh) when I ended up seeing it I was pretty disappointed all around
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) The second movie I didn't think was nearly as good as the first, which is one of my all-time favorite movies, but (uhh) the second still had some good aspects to it and it was overall a pretty enjoyable movie
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) The third one just feels completely (uhh) unneeded
NEGATIVE	 It seems like we've seen all this before, (uhh) and seen it better
NEGATIVE	 There's really not a whole lot original original (stutter) concept left in it
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) the story's just kind of a rehash of the previous movie and it overall just feels very forced

NEUTRAL	 And you know saving as always the cop goes in, save the days
NEUTRAL	 But basically this movie it was more xxx than your average action movie
POSITIVE	 The effects, like the shootout scenes, were amazing
POSITIVE	 They were done amazingly
POSITIVE	 When you're in the theater and you're watching them shootout each other you actually feel like you're there
POSITIVE	 The story it was actually done really well
NEUTRAL	So how do I write terms and conditions for my business as a small business owner?
NEUTRAL	Get some examples from industry associations of the different terms and conditions that other people in your industry use, review them, look to see how your terms and conditions might fit into those, sit down and draft them, and then have somebody look at them like a solicitor or an industry representative to see that they meet all the compliances and state regulations.
NEUTRAL	Review your draft again and then again make sure that it meets all the requirements for your products and services and the regulations and compliance that you working in.
NEUTRAL	Hi

NEGATIVE	 This is not one of my favorite movies, it doesn't seem to hold my kids attention either so no matter what the price of it is, it's not one, that I would recommend buying
POSITIVE	 It does have some special features on here, there is the trailer, there a (stutter) trivia game, there's a read along, which actually my kids actually enjoy better than the movie
NEUTRAL	Hey there expotv, Summer here
NEUTRAL	 Today we're reviewing the DVD Freedomland
NEUTRAL	 They're looking and looking and looking, and she's got a history of using drugs, and she has a history of being a liar and not not (stutter) acting appropriately and then not being (stutter) you know a person with (uhh) everything there, all her marbles together in a row
NEUTRAL	 And (uhh) that this (stutter) to me was very, very similar to some news event that had actually occurred
NEGATIVE	 And then that's when it fell off for me
NEGATIVE	 When I'm watching a movie of something you know with with (stutter) actors of this caliber I expect to watch something that's new and unique and I didn't find that with this movie
NEGATIVE	 So for me Freedomland was a total waste of time
NEGATIVE	 It was a total waste of money
NEGATIVE	 I hated the movie
NEGATIVE	 I don't think Samuel L Jackson should have been in it and I think that Julianna Moore lowered herself to play the person in this movie
NEGATIVE	 I hated the events that unfolded and I hated the ending
NEUTRAL	 Now Freedomland has Samuel L Jackson and Julianne Moore
NEUTRAL	 It is rated R for some language and some violent content and it runs about two hours long
NEUTRAL	 Now I want to tell you this from the beginning
NEGATIVE	 I do not like this movie
NEGATIVE	 I don't see any sense in Freedomland ever being made
NEGATIVE	 I understand that the movie was based on the bestselling novel, I understand that it was acted well, I understand that Julianne Moore totally was out of character by playing the person she played in this movie, but I didn't see the premise behind the movie
NEUTRAL	 Now (stutter) the premise of course is is (stutter) basically a a (stutter) white woman living in the not so white section of the city, has her car stolen and her son is in the backseat supposedly and there is a frenzy
NEGATIVE	 The entire town is trying to find her son
NEUTRAL	Hi, ExpoTV
POSITIVE	 Today I'm reviewing (umm) Zoom Academy for Superheroes
NEUTRAL	 He hasn't done any superhero work in a long time
NEUTRAL	 So he's lost his powers
NEUTRAL	 But something, you know, there's a villain and he's needed to help save the day
NEUTRAL	 So he goes in and trains all these (umm) kids who have superpowers, and he's training them how to defeat, you know, the villains
NEUTRAL	 So that's what the storyline is about
NEGATIVE	 But I didn't find it too exciting
NEUTRAL	 (umm) I don't know
NEUTRAL	 It's actually based on a novel (umm)
NEUTRAL	 I think it's called Zoom's Academy for (stutter) Supergifted
NEGATIVE	 (umm) And I have to say that I was not overly impressed with this movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It seemed to be a little bit boring (umm) getting through it
NEGATIVE	 (umm) There's a few decent stars in there where, I guess, maybe that's where my disappointment came from
POSITIVE	 I thought, Oh, this is going to be funny and good
NEUTRAL	 Tim Allen, Courteney Cox, and an old classic, Chevy Chase, in there
NEUTRAL	 So (umm) the story is about (uhh) Tim Allen's character (umm) now has lost all his powers

POSITIVE	 (uhh) But it's really good, I really enjoy it
NEUTRAL	 It's like the new movie
NEUTRAL	 It's like the the new teenage movie to watch
POSITIVE	 It's like a big hit
POSITIVE	 (uhh) Napoleon Dynamite is definitely a classic comedy of our age I guess you could say
NEUTRAL	 (umm) This is something that you'll be showing your kids just cause you know, (umm) maybe Sixteen Candles or like (umm) other movies like that (uhh) would be like a movie that your parents showed you or something
POSITIVE	 But this is definitely something you're gonna show your kids cause it's hilarious, and it's hilarious in a different way and a lot of people don't (uhh) appreciate it as much as xxx it is because they just kinda think it's funny but I think this is creatively done because I'm into like a weird humor, I guess you could say, and there's like (umm) like hidden humor in here just that (uhh) with editing and continuity and (uhh) just the way things are produced that makes it humorous in that aspect as opposed to just (uhh) the way he is
POSITIVE	 And it's (stutters) intelligently made I think
POSITIVE	 One of the best comedies out there of our age as opposed to like, those other comedies that are actually really stupid with just bad bad (stutter) jokes and what not
POSITIVE	In this lesson, you've learned a lot of concepts that we'll be applying in this course.
POSITIVE	Concepts about structuring data into tables, extracting data that we want, counting rows with aggregations and linking tables together using primary keys and joins.
NEUTRAL	1) Be ready early - We’ve heard from employers who call job seekers during their scheduled time, only to be met with a voice mail
POSITIVE	The best part about doing an interview over the phone is that you don’t have to get dressed up or worry about looking nice
NEGATIVE	Maybe your clock is a few minutes fast, maybe they were running a little behind
NEUTRAL	Whatever the case may be, treat this as you would for an in-person interview – be ready around 10 minutes early
NEUTRAL	This will ensure you won’t miss their call and will also give you some time before the interview starts to go over any final points you want to remember
POSITIVE	[BROLL] Interviewee is nicely dressed sitting at a table with a with pen, notepad, glass of water and phone

POSITIVE	 I personally love the to-do list with my next tasks, and there's a lot more! The pricing is also great
POSITIVE	 It was very important for us to make it affordable for small businesses, so while pricing starts at $29 per user It's easy to reduce the price to five dollars by sharing it with friends
NEUTRAL	So what we started doing was ask the question why don't we see the effect of advertising on prices and profits as much as we would like to see or at least what the lab studies would suggest?
POSITIVE	So we dug a little bit deeper into this and again developed a very sound economics OR type of model.
POSITIVE	Our nationwide registry includes thousands of the best and most qualified accountants, accounting firms and audit firms.

NEUTRAL	Now you are saying to yourself, well why do I want to know everything if they're going to tell me what they want me to say anyway?
NEUTRAL	 I often visit my clients  in order to to inform them about new products that we have  and to let them know  that Mi-Bospo is supporting their business
NEUTRAL	This is my video review of The (uhh) Simpsons Movie
NEGATIVE	 If you haven't seen this movie by now I don't really think you should
NEGATIVE	 (stutter) I guess I didn't like the plot so once the plot got ruined, I really didn't care
NEGATIVE	 The movie seemed to kinda drag on for me and it wasn't even that long
NEGATIVE	 It was definitely a comedy and I guess if you're a true Simpsons fan you're gonna wanna see the movie
NEGATIVE	 But you're probably just gonna end up wasting about six bucks
NEGATIVE	 So if you're thinking about seeing it, I wouldn't recommend it
NEGATIVE	 Maybe rent it, that's probably gonna be cheaper and if you rent it, I wouldn't really expect too much cause really you can see a lot funnier stuff in the show, and the shows are free
NEUTRAL	 It's been out in theaters quite awhile
NEGATIVE	 I'm pretty sure they'll be taking it out soon and in my opinion, this is pretty much just a big let down
NEGATIVE	 There (stutter) wasn't that many funny parts in the movie and the only funny parts that there actually were I had already seen cause they were in the commercials
NEGATIVE	 So if you own a TV and you saw the commercials, I wouldn't recommend seeing the movie, and even if you didn't see the commercials, I wouldn't really recommend the movie
POSITIVE	 I mean, I love the Simpsons and pretty much they're always funny
NEGATIVE	 Some people don't like the current seasons, but I still think that they're pretty funny, and I was really let down by the movie
NEGATIVE	 So I mean the whole plot was kind of stupid
NEUTRAL	 They're trying to save Springfield
NEUTRAL	Hi, this is Brian
NEUTRAL	 I'd like to talk to you about a movie
POSITIVE	 Again, this is All of Me
NEUTRAL	 It's called All of Me
NEUTRAL	 It's actually kind of a short movie
NEUTRAL	 It's only like ninety-one minutes long
NEUTRAL	 (umm) This is the Gold Reel Collection
NEGATIVE	 (umm), It's kind of a slow movie
NEUTRAL	 It does star Lily Tomlin, and Steve Martin
POSITIVE	 (umm) It's interesting that Steve Martin is an an (stutter) attorney or lawyer, but he wants to be a magician, and, (umm) Lily Tomlin, (umm) is a spinster and I don't want to give away too much of the plot but she ends up being inside of (umm) her spirit becomes inside of (umm) Steve Martin and that's where a lot of the interesting things in the movie come in
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It wasn't one of my favorite movies, but (umm) I'd probably give it a two but, two out of five stars but (umm), if you haven't seen the movie maybe you want to rent it before you you (stutter) purchase it but you can probably get it for ten dollars because it's been out for a little bit
NEUTRAL	Hello Expo Tv
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) I'm here today to review the movie Michael Clayton currently in theaters
NEGATIVE	 So (uhh) I give the movie two out of five stars
NEUTRAL	 George Clooney does alright
NEGATIVE	 And I don't know, it makes you think a little bit but most of the time you're just thinking I wish I didn't watch this movie
NEGATIVE	 So save your money and go see something else
NEUTRAL	 Until next time
NEGATIVE	 (umm) If you're like most people including myself, you probably will not enjoy this movie because I most definitely did not
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) most people would call it a law thriller
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) Kind of like, John Grisham kind of books but Maybe more along the lines of like a two thousand page John Grisham book
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It's just, it's far too long
NEGATIVE	 If you even look at the other Expo TV reviews about this movie, even the people that like the movie all seem to agree, the movie's way too long
POSITIVE	 (uhh) The movie stars John Grisham, I mean {laughter} the movie stars George Clooney as Michael Clayton and (uhh) he actually, he does a pretty decent job and (uhh) anyways, Michael Clayton is (uhh) the fixer of the law firm, (uhh) takes care of all the messy messy (stutter) corporate cases
NEGATIVE	 And also kind of complicating this is the fact that his personal life sort of unraveling with gambling and family problems and all sorts of things and basically he gets to the point where he just gets completely sick of fixing everyone's mistakes and it just kinda compounds and (uhh) I don't wanna ruin it for you, but
NEGATIVE	 Hopefully you're not gonna see it anyway because it sucks
NEUTRAL	Hello my name is Sarah and I will be doing my video opinion on the movie Shall We Dance? (uhh) starring Jennifer Lopez, Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon
NEGATIVE	 (umm) You know I really didn't enjoy this movie at all (uhh) it was, kinda boring for me, (umm) it kinda felt as if there were parts in there they just put in there to kinda pass the time on
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Basically the movie is about (umm) Richard Gere's character and him being a workaholic
NEUTRAL	 (umm) He's looking for some some (stutter) extra sizzle to add into his life and he meets up with a dance instructor who is played by Jennifer Lopez and basically she convinces him to sign up for some ballroom lessons
POSITIVE	 He gets into it, he enjoys it a lot but he's still keeping a secret from his family so he is trying to cope with having this this (stutter) you know, exciting moment added to his life and trying to keep it from his family so he's trying to figure out how to balance everything and you know I mean the dance scenes in here I felt were fantastic I thought Jennifer Lopez did a fantastic job and the girl really can dance (umm) as as (stutter) far as that goes, that's pretty much it
NEGATIVE	 I think the movie was horrible, it was kinda boring but (uhh) if you like to see some dancing, then hey pick it up if not
NEUTRAL	Hi, my name is Mike, and this is my review for Mr
NEUTRAL	 Magorium's Wonder Emporium and (uhh) this was a film that we took our two year old to (uhh) just a couple days ago

NEUTRAL	 Magorium's Wonder Emporium
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Save your money and rent (uhh) the classic Willy Wonka and you'll enjoy (uhh) the experience a whole lot better
NEUTRAL	 And my name is Mike, that's been my movie review
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It's probably one of the worst films (uhh) I've seen probably in the last five or six years
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The main reason why was there wasn't much of a plot but it was pretty boring
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Not, not (stutter) really a lot of interesting things (uhh) seemed to occur during the (uhh) during the show
POSITIVE	 (umm) One of the things that was (uhh) kind of interesting is it seems to be a cross between Willy Wonka and (uhh) and some other Christmas style movies (uhh) in which they're just hoping to kind of show you some (uhh) interesting, colorful scenery (uhh) and have a toy store in which you walk by things and things pop out and weird stuff happens
NEGATIVE	 But (uhh) that just after maybe a minute or two of that and it becomes, you become used to it, you're just really not interested in seeing any more of that
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Dustin Hoffman (uhh) is kind of bizarre (uhh) cast as this (uhh) particular person and Natalie Portman seems to just be sleepwalking through the role
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) (stutter) Everybody involved in this movie (uhh) seems to just be cashing a paycheck
NEGATIVE	 It's a horrible, terrible film and so I I (stutter) can't (uhh) recommend it whatsoever
NEUTRAL	Hi, my name is Anaj, and today I'm reviewing the movie Saawariya which is currently running in theaters (uhh) nationwide

NEGATIVE	 I just lost three hours of my time for nothing
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Now about Saawariya
NEGATIVE	 I do not have good words for this movie
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) I think it's like one of the worst movies I've ever seen
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) Well the the (stutter) thing is that it stars this new guy who's son of the old heroes so it's kind of his (stutter) launch in, you know, home production
NEUTRAL	 So it's (uhh) the story goes like, you know, there's (uhh) this new singer dancer at a bar which is in the call girl area or the red light area kind of thing and he falls in love with this girl, but this girl is in love with some other person so, you know, the story is whether he'll actually get the girl or not and, you know, how he pursues that
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The only good thing about this movie are the songs and the dances
NEGATIVE	 So if you're a fan of Indian songs and the dances that go along with it you may want to watch this movie but otherwise I'll just rate this movie one out of five
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Was bad, bad (stutter) part of New York actually, you know, going to the movies
POSITIVE	Hello, my name is Sara and I will be doing my video opinion on the classic Elf, (umm) starring the wonderful comedian Will Ferrell

POSITIVE	 He's going through all these different things
NEUTRAL	 He decides to work at a toy store
POSITIVE	 (umm) This is just really cool and this, what I like about this DVD is that it gives you an option
NEUTRAL	 It gives you two discs, (umm) which one is for widescreen and one is for full screen
POSITIVE	 Which is great I think (umm) you know, someone who really doesn't, I don't really like widescreen so I'm great that it gives me an option
POSITIVE	 So again I really think you should pick it up
NEUTRAL	 So basically he lived his whole life you know (umm) thinking he was an elf
NEUTRAL	 Of course he was the tallest kid
NEUTRAL	 Like he couldn't fit in the seats, you know he always outgrew all the other elves so he always had wondered you know, why was he so different
NEUTRAL	 So he finds out that he (umm) has a dad somewhere else (uhh) and he travels to New York City
POSITIVE	 (umm) This movie is is (stutter) definitely hilarious
NEUTRAL	 (umm) It goes through the you know, different things that he had experienced being in New York
POSITIVE	 (umm) Experiencing you know, a whole new life change
POSITIVE	 (umm) Which I thought was you know, really cool
POSITIVE	interested in this opportunity and passionate about the industry that he wants to be able to join
POSITIVE	Therefore he can add value and be a great fit for this organization
POSITIVE	Now you want to make sure that you practice practice practice
POSITIVE	It is almost guaranteed that you're going to get a question similar to this one so you want to make sure that you're selling what the interviewer is buying
POSITIVE	Think about what they'll be interested in by really understanding the job description and the traits that they're looking for in the job description
POSITIVE	Make sure you focus on those strengths
NEUTRAL	Hi, my name is Anaj and today I'm reviewing the movie Lions for Lambs which is currently playing in theaters nationwide

NEGATIVE	 I mean only if you have an additional two hours in your life that you have nothing to do go watch that movie
NEGATIVE	 It stars Robert Redford, Tom Cruise, Meryl (stutter) Streep, and you know that's about it, that's the only good thing about the movie, there's nothing else that is good about this movie and I'll tell you why
NEUTRAL	 So (stutter) so Tom cruise is a senator and (uhh) Meryl Streep is a (uhh) reporter from one of the newspapers or magazine or TV that I'm not very sure, but she's, she's (stutter) a reporter
NEUTRAL	 So one of the scenes is going on in Tom Cruise's office where the reporter and Tom Cruise are talking to each other
NEUTRAL	 The other scene is back in Afghanistan and there's a platoon of, you know, the army, the marines who are kind of fighting, and the third is actually a philosophy professor who's talking to his student in his office
NEGATIVE	 And (stutter) all the three of the, you know, all the three scenes are kind of related to each other because they're talking about why did the US go to war with Afghanistan and Iraq and what was the reason and what can be done now? And (stutter) you know whatever they talk about it's, they try to make a (stutter) drama out of it, a dramatic movie out of it, but really doesn't make sense, you know
NEGATIVE	 (stutter) Everyone that I've talked to, I saw the movie I hated it
NEGATIVE	 Everyone I talks to said that it did not make any sense
NEUTRAL	 You know with all these star casts, these (stutter) star collectors in there, you know, that you go watch Tom Cruise in theaters (uhh) you know he hasn't been in theaters for a while now
NEUTRAL	Hey guys, today we've got Men In Black Two which is the sequel to the first Men In Black based on the (uhh) I believe it was a Dark Horse comic starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones
NEUTRAL	 And in the back we're playing just the opening scene when when (stutter) Will Smith is riding this giant worm creature through the tunnels so he can rescue the innocent citizens of New York
NEUTRAL	 And (uhh) this movie I thought was a very inferior sequel, it was good it had some good moments, some good elements to it
POSITIVE	 (uhh) Some of the comedy was good there was still a decent chemistry between (uhh) Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) Rosario Dawson shows up for her first blockbuster appearance (umm) later on she went to star in a lot of movies by Edward Burns and in Sin City and some other movies, Alexander
NEGATIVE	 And (umm) well overall the movie just wasn't as good, the props were just as interesting the design was just as (uhh) good
NEGATIVE	 The effects were (stutter) not quite as good I thought they could have been a bit better given the fact that it was a few years later and that (uhh) you know ILM standards are continually evolving
NEGATIVE	 It just wasn't as funny, wasn't as entertaining

NEUTRAL	Hi, today I am reviewing the DVD movie, Scary Movie
NEUTRAL	 (umm) It says on the box, it's hilarious and outrageous
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The writing is bad and (umm) it just looks like a low budget film to me
NEGATIVE	 I really didn't find it that funny
NEUTRAL	 I think it's geared more toward (umm) the younger teenage, preteen audience even though it's definitely not appropriate for them
NEUTRAL	 This movie takes (umm) horror movies and makes spoofs on them so it's actually a comedy movie
NEUTRAL	 As you can see, it's playing here in the background (umm) it features mostly high school kids so (umm) hence the audience is geared towards
NEGATIVE	 I (umm) like I said definitely do not waste your eighty-eight minutes (umm) xxx (umm) watching this
NEGATIVE	 (umm) There are much better movies out there
NEGATIVE	 If you're looking for comedy, then {laughter} rent or buy a comedy and if you're looking for something that's going to scare you, then I would definitely just rent or buy a horror movie because this movie just didn't do it for me

NEUTRAL	 (umm) You might enjoy it one time
POSITIVE	 (umm) If you're an Elvis fan, you like seeing a bunch of guys dressed up as Elvis, you might like it even more than I do
NEGATIVE	 So anyways, two out of five stars
NEUTRAL	 This stars Kurt Russell and (umm) (uhh) Kevin Costner
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) three thousand Miles to Graceland, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner
NEUTRAL	 And what it is about (umm) two guys that are teamed up to (umm) go make a daring (umm) robbery of a casino in Las Vegas
NEUTRAL	 And the twist is that it's during an Elvis (umm) (uhh) conference
NEUTRAL	 And everybody is dressed up as Elvis

NEUTRAL	Hey this is Dan with a review of The Simpsons the Movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I have been an avid fan of The Simpsons most of my life, and (uhh) was quite disappointed that the movie wasn't anything more spectacular than in an overblown episode per se
NEUTRAL	 (umm) The Simpsons the Movie basically (umm) (uhh) it serves on the premise of (umm) basically the entire town (umm) being at the verge of a toxic waste dump and ready to be quarantined
POSITIVE	 (umm) When things happen that makes it such, (umm) the national government steps in and tries to seal it off in a bubble of sorts
POSITIVE	 (umm) The premise isn't anything too far fetched out of a wacky Simpsons episode, and the postmodern (uhh) references within it to (uhh) movies like Titanic and (umm) other references or nothing more than something you might expect from a halloween special to The Shining or something like that
NEGATIVE	 So there was nothing too novel about it, I didn't find it particularly funny, particularly interesting and definitely not worth a ticket price (umm) let alone probably wanting to purchase this movie unless you get it at a really good deal
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It is a overblown episode, would not highly recommend it out of five, (uhh) out of four stars I would probably give this two
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) Out of five it's definitely two
NEGATIVE	 But The Simpsons The Movie not worthwhile in my book
NEGATIVE	 It has cooler animation stressing more three D at the perspectives but nothing too revolutionary, so with that, The Simpsons the Movie, (umm) not something I'd really keep in my collection unless you can get it for a pretty good deal despite the donuts
NEUTRAL	Hi
NEUTRAL	 I am Chris and this is a review of the DVD, The Last Castle starring Robert Redford and James Gandolfini
NEGATIVE	 It's a fairly (uhh) promising premise at the beginning but the (uhh) execution was just poor and it can't make up it's mind if it's (uhh) a prison story or a action movie or (uhh) exactly or military inquest (uhh) type of a conspiracy movie
NEGATIVE	 It just can't make up it's mind what it is and falls apart in every level and (umm) by the end, you're just not interested anymore
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) As far as the DVD itself goes, special features (umm) on this includes pretty standard theatrical trailer, production notes, deleted scenes, commentary and (uhh) a little HBO movie called (uhh) Inside The Castle Walls about military prisons and things like that
NEGATIVE	 Really (umm) it's not, it's not worth your time
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Maybe if it's on TV, you might watch it then, but really, I wouldn't bother with The Last Castle on DVD
NEUTRAL	 (umm) In this movie, Robert Redford plays a (umm) military general sent to (umm) prison for a crime, sort of a technicality of a crime (umm) but he is sent to a military prison and the warden of the prison is James Gandolfini, best known for his role in the sopranos
NEUTRAL	 And once there, Robert Redford finds that the prison is hopelessly corrupt and some of the inmates are being murdered and (uhh) James Gandolfini's character, the warden, (uhh) is running the prison (uhh) like a despot and (uhh) there's just a whole bunch of bad things going on inside the prison that shouldn't be happening
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) Robert Redford decides to do something about it and takes command and runs the military prison as sort of a military camp
NEGATIVE	 (umm) This movie starts out okay but quickly devolves, (umm) it doesn't end up being very good
NEGATIVE	 I am not exactly sure (uhh) what Robert Redford is doing in this movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I feel maybe he lost a bet (umm) towards the end of this movie, it just becomes (uhh) silly
NEGATIVE	 The ending was a little bit surprising but by then I I (stutter) really didn't care anymore
NEGATIVE	 (umm) This movie, it doesn't turn out to be as good as it starts out
NEUTRAL	Hi here with me today I have the DVD called The Ghost and the Darkness
NEUTRAL	 It has Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer in it
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It's, it (stutter), I wouldn't suggest this, it's (uhh) not a, not a very great movie, not all very well put together
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I don't think is one of the best movies (uhh) ever it's about (umm) is about (uhh) two guys who go to Africa because they've been called upon because (uhh) a village over there in East Africa, this is set in 1996, has a problem because there's two man-eating lion, lions (stutter) who are (uhh) killing a lot of the people there
NEUTRAL	 So these people are commissioned to hunt the animals
POSITIVE	 So they have a lot of problems (umm) during that time and they set up traps which the lions (umm) actually (uhh) outsmart them with, so it's actually kind of interesting
NEGATIVE	 But it's a very drawn out long movie, (umm) not really interesting the ending's pretty lame and kind of flops in the end
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Which is why I guess this movie this movie (stutter) didn't really (uhh) hit big or anything
NEUTRAL	 But (uhh) (uhh) this is (uhh) I wouldn't, it's not really a action movie I'd classify more as like a, it's like a story
NEGATIVE	 (umm) And then you don't feel sympathetic for anybody in this movie
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Not the lions, not the people, not the hunters or the (umm) village people so there's nobody really to side with in here
NEUTRAL	This is Fantastic Four, the first one
NEUTRAL	 It's playing here in the screen
NEGATIVE	 But the story was so bad that I actually considered leaving halfway through the movie
NEGATIVE	 So, don't go out there and get this movie please, because it's really not worth it
NEGATIVE	 If you wanna see a good superhero, if you wanna see a good superhero movie, go see any of the Spider-Mans, go see any of the go see Batman Begins, that's a good one, or go see any of the X-Men
POSITIVE	 Those are all great movies
NEGATIVE	 This movie just jumped on the superhero bandwagon and just did not do a good job at retelling the true story of the Fantastic Four group
NEGATIVE	 It just didn't do it any honor
NEGATIVE	 I would be ashamed to have made this film if I was a director
NEGATIVE	 So I don't suggest you go out there to watch it and waste your money on this DVD
NEGATIVE	 What can I say about this? It stars Jessica Alba and though she may be pretty, she's not the best actress
NEGATIVE	 The movie is just really not that great
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) The acting in it is mediocre
NEGATIVE	 The special effects in it is the same and so is the script and story
NEGATIVE	 All of it's mediocre
NEGATIVE	 The direction was was (stutter) horrible
NEGATIVE	 I was completely unsatisfied by this movie
NEUTRAL	 (umm) There's not much else to say besides that
NEUTRAL	This is the Nicholas Cage film Windtalkers directed by John Woo
NEUTRAL	 Here's a clip, clip playing on the television screen
NEUTRAL	 You know what I mean, like throwing a, throwing a (stutter) suitcase across the grounds very dramatic
NEUTRAL	 Running across the room is very dramatic when everyone is shooting at you
NEGATIVE	 But, war movies are supposed to be as a whole dramatic
NEGATIVE	 But he tries to make every single little tidbit of it very dramatic and very it becomes very awkward
NEGATIVE	 Nicholas Cage does his best, but he can't just pull it off
NEGATIVE	 (umm) There's a scene where they mix actual real life cannon firing video with filmed video, and it's just very awkward to watch
NEGATIVE	 I didn't enjoy it at all
NEGATIVE	 The musical score was no good
NEGATIVE	 A lot of the movie is just more awkward than it is entertaining
NEGATIVE	 So I don't suggest going out there and finding Windtalkers
NEGATIVE	 (umm), I'm going to have to say do not get this movie
NEGATIVE	 Save yourself the money, get yourself another Nicholas Cage movie
NEUTRAL	 I don't know, like Face-Off
POSITIVE	 That's a good John Woo, Nicholas Cage movie
NEGATIVE	 Do not go out there and watch it
NEGATIVE	 It's just no good
NEGATIVE	 Usually I'm a big Nicholas Cage fan but this time he completely missed his mark
NEGATIVE	 But I feel like it was John Woo to blame
NEUTRAL	 John Woo does martial arts
NEUTRAL	 He does not do war films
POSITIVE	 And martial arts really like to emphasize dramatic scenes every single second
POSITIVE	Hi Expo TV, this is Melissa and you can check out my reviews at PM three two one to see (uhh), what I've been reviewing lately

POSITIVE	 I give it a five out of five, and it's something you need to check out
POSITIVE	 Basically, this movie, changed (umm), the way movies are made now

POSITIVE	 (umm) There's some good special features on this (uhh), DVD
NEUTRAL	 You have behind-the-scenes documentaries, cast and crew commentary, music only audio track, follow the white rabbit and take the red pills for more mysteries, mind bending extras
NEUTRAL	 (umm) We also have interactive menus, filmographies, (uhh) scene access, English subtitles, and more
POSITIVE	 (umm) basically this is what it says on the back here and (uhh), I was trying to think of a way to describe this movie because it's just so complex, and the way they put it on the back just (umm), it's the right way to say it
NEUTRAL	 (umm), Our perception is our day in and day out world is real
NEUTRAL	 And the reality is the world is a hoax and elaborate (stutter) decept, (uhh) deception spun by an all power, spun by all powerful machines of artificial intelligence that control us
NEUTRAL	Hello, I'm reviewing the movie The Missing starring Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett
POSITIVE	 (uhh) This is another Ron Howard film
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) But nothing really great
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Didn't get it
NEGATIVE	 Didn't understand it
NEGATIVE	 As far as it being a Ron Howard film I was actually fairly disappointed
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) This particular version actually comes with the first disc which has the movie on it and then you have the second disc that has a whole lot of (uhh) bonus features
NEUTRAL	 Actually (umm) three alternate endings
NEGATIVE	 Maybe if they would've picked another one it would've been been better
POSITIVE	 (uhh) Eleven deleted scenes and eleven behind the scenes featurettes (umm) and a lot of other stuff as well
NEGATIVE	 So I would not recommend this one, (uhh) even with all the bonus footage
NEUTRAL	 (umm) It's supposes, supposed (stutter) to be a suspense movie
POSITIVE	 (umm) Essentially what happens is (uhh) Cate Blanchett (uhh) is living on the prairie and (uhh) someone or something comes in and captures her daughter
NEUTRAL	 Kidnaps one of the two girls and takes off with her and Tommy Lee Jones is actually Cate Blanchett's father
NEUTRAL	 He shows up (uhh) to help find the girl
NEUTRAL	 He's an indian tracker (umm) so he has the ability (uhh) to help find the girl
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I gotta say I honestly didn't get this one
NEGATIVE	 I didn't think Tommy Lee Jones (uhh) pulled off this role at all
POSITIVE	 (uhh) Thought Cate Blanchett did a great, did a good job
POSITIVE	Hi this is Dan with my review of The Namesake available on DVD
NEUTRAL	 This movie tracks the story of two generations of Indian Americans that (uhh) basically believe their homeland to come to America
NEUTRAL	 (umm) The father and mother have two (umm) children a son and a daughter here in America and they try to identify basically who they are and how they fit in in this culture
NEUTRAL	 The (uhh) generation divide and also with cultural issues are illustrated in this movie
NEGATIVE	 And (umm) unfortunately this serious theme drags on for quite a long time
NEGATIVE	 And (uhh) unless you have great interest in this subject, I frankly lost a bit of interest rather quickly so (uhh) it wasn't the best movie to me
NEUTRAL	 In my opinion I, I (stutter) only give it two out of five stars
POSITIVE	 The Namesake does tackle a serious topic and (umm) it does a good job portraying life although kind of depressingly as our main character (umm) struggles in life to find out who he is and how he fits in
NEUTRAL	 The Namesake (umm) is rated PG-thirteen and (umm) generally pretty benign of a movie (uhh) so available on DVD
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) I again recommend it with two of five stars
NEUTRAL	Hi, this is Jack and I'm reviewing the new movie out (umm) The Good Shepherd, (umm) starring Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, so I mean, obviously you can tell it's got an all-star cast
NEGATIVE	 But unfortunately, I don't think an all-star cast really makes up or really makes the film
NEGATIVE	 I mean I was really really disappointed
NEGATIVE	 With an all-star cast like this, apparently good director, you know and excellent story, you'd think they'd be able to do it but I don't think it was worth it
NEUTRAL	 (umm) This is for, this is (stutter) Robert De Niro's return to directing for since the last thirteen years
NEGATIVE	 I really really wish he could have done a better job
NEUTRAL	 (umm) I mean the story involved with the CIA part of it, with Matt Damon you know in the CIA, it's it's (stutter) interesting, but sometimes it seems kind of stretched out
NEGATIVE	 And there are parts of it that are boring, but the really bad part about the movie is all these things all these parts having to do with his family
NEGATIVE	 I mean I understand that's kind of an important part of a movie but it made up about a third of the movie and I really wanted to sleep through all of it
NEUTRAL	 (stutter) The movie is almost three hours long
NEGATIVE	 So I mean it's a really really long movie
NEGATIVE	 I was bored through most of it
NEUTRAL	Hi, I'm here to review In the Name of the King
NEUTRAL	 It's a film currently in theaters
NEGATIVE	 This one doesn't even offer that it's just boring more than anything
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It tries to be Lord of the Rings
NEGATIVE	 It has a many of orge like creatures, a wizard, a medieval time setting
NEGATIVE	 Basically stole everything out of Lord of the Rings but made a million times worse
NEGATIVE	 (umhh) It's just everyone stay away from this film
NEGATIVE	 It was a horrible movie
NEUTRAL	 (umm) So yea that's In the Name of the King in a nutshell
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It's based on the xxx series of video games
NEGATIVE	 This one was horrible
NEGATIVE	 I'm giving it a one out of five
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It takes place in medieval times and it's about an ongoing war between (umm) I don't even know
NEGATIVE	 {laughter} This movie had horrible plot, horrible acting, horrible dialogue, horrible special effects, horrible action
NEGATIVE	 There was no saving grace for this film
NEGATIVE	 It starred Jason Statham so I thought it would be good cause he tends to be in pretty good movies but no, this was a let down
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It's directed by Uwe Boll who is known for making pretty bad movies however this film see (uhh) most of his films are bad enough that they're funny, you can laugh at them
NEUTRAL	Hi, I'm Chris, and this is a review of the DVD of the movie Constantine starring Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weiss
NEUTRAL	 (umm) In this movie Keanu Reeves plays a sort of (umm) exorcist kind of a character where he performs exorcisms and he is (uhh) in touch with the demon world
NEUTRAL	 He's not bad but (umm), I don't know
NEGATIVE	 This movie just didn't do it for me
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I really didn't enjoy it
NEGATIVE	 I I (stutter) slogged my way through it but it it (stutter) really wasn't that interesting
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I really wouldn't recommend this, I've seen this sort of (uhh) theme done better
NEUTRAL	 (umm) As far as the DVD goes there are eighteen minutes of additional footage which usually (umm) these scenes are cut out of the movie for a pretty good reason
NEGATIVE	 They really don't add anything to the movie
NEGATIVE	 There's an alternate ending which isn't any better or any worse than the original ending, then there's you know theatrical content, (uhh) theatrical trailer and different languages and stuff like that
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Maybe rent this but I definitely wouldn't buy it
NEUTRAL	 So that's the DVD of the movie Constantine starring Keanu Reeves
NEUTRAL	 (umm) His character is John Constantine, hence the title, and this is based on a series of (uhh) graphic novels and he he (stutter) can see demons and he can see (umm) otherworld spirits and he basically fights them
NEUTRAL	 He has (uhh) some fairly strange weapons that he uses this, that he uses to do this
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Holy water and a shotgun made out of a crucifix
NEGATIVE	 It's a fairly strange movie
NEUTRAL	 (umm) I know it's based on a graphic novel and those movies can tend to (uhh) run on the strange side
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) This movie's a little stranger than most, it really was very odd
NEUTRAL	 (umm) If you're into this kind of stuff I guess it was okay
POSITIVE	 There's a big sort of (uhh) conspiracy to unleash a bunch of demons from hell and (umm) Keanu Reeves is trying to stop this and (umm) Rachel Weiss plays a cop who sort of reluctantly agrees to help him, basically reluctantly because she doesn't really believe him and he has an assistant who (uhh) the assistant has some pretty funny parts
NEUTRAL	Hi expo
NEUTRAL	 This is my review on the movie The Ladykillers
NEGATIVE	 So (umm) I'd probably give this one a two and if you wanna check it out (umm) you might like it better than I did
POSITIVE	 That's The Ladykillers
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I'm a big Tom Hanks fan but I really wasn't all that impressed with this movie
NEGATIVE	 It seemed like there was a lot of drag time in this movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Yeah there were (stutter) some funny scenes but (uhh) very few
NEGATIVE	 And (umm) for a Tom Hanks movie I was really let down
NEUTRAL	 (umm) However that is my opinion and (umm) it's rated R for language, crude scenes, (uhh) some violence and (umm) it's a hundred and four minutes long
NEUTRAL	 There's several different actors in this movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) And however, you know, (stutter) it's just not as great as I expected it to be
NEGATIVE	 And again I think this is another movie where my expectations were a lot higher than they should have been
NEUTRAL	Hello, I'm doing a movie review of the movie Eragon
NEUTRAL	 It is in theaters almost everywhere
NEGATIVE	 {noise} So I (uhh) tried to struggle through it
NEUTRAL	 I went to get some popcorn
NEGATIVE	 Ate it, wondered if I'd like the movie if I were eating and not paying full attention to it but I didn't really like it any more
NEUTRAL	 It's probably a movie for younger boys
NEUTRAL	 Younger boys who can't quite grasp a full plot
NEUTRAL	 It's for younger boys who maybe have read the book too because then they'll like seeing everything they read in the book come to life
NEGATIVE	 One thing I found cheesy and awkward about the movie was how the dragon and the main boy Eragon talked with their minds
NEUTRAL	 Let me do an impression of them
NEGATIVE	 That is what they looked like when they talked and it was awful
NEGATIVE	 Hard to watch
POSITIVE	 Now I'm a fan of Harry Potter, I've seen all the Harry Potter movies
NEUTRAL	 But maybe the younger kids would like it
NEUTRAL	 So if you're a younger kid then maybe watch it
NEUTRAL	 I also have seen all of the Lord of the Rings movies
NEGATIVE	 Now the Lord of the Rings movies got a little long for me
NEUTRAL	 Though they were still good
NEGATIVE	 I found Eragon's plot to be a little thin
NEGATIVE	 And actually, while I was at Eragon I wanted to be Eragone out of the theater and away from that movie
NEGATIVE	 Because I found it boring
NEGATIVE	 It wanted me to go to, go to (stutter) sleep to be honest
NEUTRAL	Alright Expo TV, this is my video review of the movie Sweeney Todd
POSITIVE	 (umm) This movie, when I saw it, this movie looked sweet
NEUTRAL	 It has the same director as the guy from Nightmare Before Christmas
NEGATIVE	 Figured this was gonna sweet movie, I didn't think he'd, well I mean I really wasn't probably thinking at all, because if you think about it, The Nightmare Before Christmas is sort of like a musical
NEGATIVE	 So, I don't know, I made a bad choice with this movie
NEGATIVE	 I don't think it's fair of me to give it a one out of five, but that's what I'm gonna give it
POSITIVE	 I mean it had everything, it looked I mean it was about this serial killer like barber guy and it had Johnny Depp and he was dressed up looking all sweet and so I was like yes I'm gonna go see this movie
NEGATIVE	 I obviously did not do enough research before I saw the movie, which you are a good person if you're watching this video because you're trying to do some research before you go out there and spend the (umm) looks like six fifty on the movie
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) This movie is a musical
NEGATIVE	 So, if you don't like musicals, don't go see this movie
NEGATIVE	 As soon as they started singing, I was just like, what did I get myself into, you know? I mean, I couldn't, I could not (stutter) get past that
NEGATIVE	 So, if you can get past the fact that there's Johnny Depp singing in this movie, (uhh) more power to you I guess
NEGATIVE	 You're gonna enjoy this one
NEGATIVE	 I did not
NEUTRAL	Hello
POSITIVE	 I like to tell you about a movie I saw recently
NEUTRAL	 Actually I think Grendel was basically another group of people that were trying to take over another society
NEGATIVE	 The monster possibly were wearing these huge face masks so this movie didn't portray it like that
POSITIVE	 They actually had Grendel as some really ugly monster and Angelina Jolie as a gorgeous mother who would make Grendel look like a sweet heart because she was so evil
NEUTRAL	 So of her good looks because they didn't try to, you know, make her look evil, they just had her made her look like (stutter) Angelina Jolie with extra gloss
NEGATIVE	 I mean, we don't need that, she has lips we know we see them she doesn't need that
NEGATIVE	 So (umm) I am disappointed in the way it was presented
NEGATIVE	 It is an epic tale, it's a good story, it's a great history about people, (umm) animation of the the (stutter) new age (uhh) type deal was terrible, and like I said she didn't fit the character
POSITIVE	 John Malkovich was okay he didn't help though
NEUTRAL	 It's Beowulf starring Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich
NEGATIVE	 This movie could have been really great if they had taken into the direction of three-hundred or possibly Lord of the Rings, they didn't do that
NEUTRAL	 (umm) The premise of the story (uhh) first of all this is a poem or a story written by an unknown character as it's the first ever written that we have found (uhh) besides Homers
POSITIVE	 (umm) It's (uhh) a great story really about a lifestyle of people
POSITIVE	 (umm) Beowulf is a good guy
NEUTRAL	 Grendel is a really bad guy, he's a monster
NEUTRAL	 Beowulf and the community around him have to protect themselves from Grendel
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Actually I this in college a very long time, for so long that you began to hate it but, then I look back and I kind of understand why it was important to learn about it
NEUTRAL	Hi, I'm reviewing the movie Rocky Balboa, which is currently in theaters
NEUTRAL	 It is the sixth edition in the Rocky series
NEUTRAL	 You know the acting was okay
NEGATIVE	 You all know it's the same thing over and over that happens with Rocky movies
NEGATIVE	 If they would have stopped Rocky one, I think it would have been great but, you know
POSITIVE	 (uhh) (uhh) You know, scene wise, there are a couple of good scenes in it
POSITIVE	 So if you're a Rocky, I guess if you're a die hard Rocky fan, this is a great movie
NEGATIVE	 But as I said before, if you if you (stutter) haven't been feeling the other Rocky movies as of late, I wouldn't waste my time seeing this
NEUTRAL	 I saw it because it was a friend of mine recommended it
NEGATIVE	 But (ehh) it was a waste of time so keep that in mind before you go and waste ten dollars on this overrated and highly dragged out movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It's it's (stutter) gotten great reviews around but, to tell you the truth, I thought they should have stopped at Rocky one
NEUTRAL	 (umm) I just thought this was too much
NEGATIVE	 Sylvester Stallone was a great actor but he's now pushing sixty and having him in this role, you know, same old thing, you know
NEUTRAL	 He goes out, we all know he's gonna fight, he's gonna win
NEGATIVE	 So, it was a, it's a typical Rocky movie but I see where it got some good reviews but I'm pretty much a little tired of the whole Rocky scene
NEGATIVE	 So if you weren't liking Rockys three, four, five, then trust me, you do not want to see this movie
NEGATIVE	 Don't waste your money
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) I don't know how some people loved it
NEUTRAL	What I have up for review here is the New Line platinum series widescreen edition of The Wedding Crashers, starring Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson and Christopher Walken

POSITIVE	 I suggest going to pick this up tonight if you were looking for a hilarious comedy
POSITIVE	 Go out and rent it, it's great
NEUTRAL	 Longer, wilder and funnier
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) The movie takes place during a wedding party (uhh) initially
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) The two characters actually play wedding crasher where they try to charm their way into the hearts of bridesmaids and hope to go home with them later that evening
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) But during this one party of the US (uhh) Secretary of Treasury, played by Christopher Walken (uhh) the guys, Owen Wilson's character actually finds himself falling for (uhh) the Secretary's daughter, and they invite them to go home with them to their estate over the weekend and he actually (uhh) pleads Vince Vaughns character to come with him and join him (uhh) over the weekend at this big estate
POSITIVE	 And most of the movie takes place at this estate
POSITIVE	 It's hilarious
NEUTRAL	 (umm) I was laughing (stutter) right through the movie
POSITIVE	 I can't even stop laughing
NEUTRAL	Hello, I'm going to do a movie review and it is about the previous number one movie Meet the Spartans
NEUTRAL	 Well there's one thing that you need to know about Meet the Spartans, it is like three hundred, (stutter) obviously as you should know
NEGATIVE	 Like when (umm) xxx it was really offensive and it wasn't that funny and like they were they (stutter) like pretty they go to the extreme all the time
NEGATIVE	 Like, they also (umm) explain the riff of the materials they use so it's like, what the heck? I, the first twenty minutes when I watched it, it was kinda like three hundred, but a little bit different by adding comedy
NEGATIVE	 It wasn't that great, it wasn't (stutter) good and it wasn't that funny
NEGATIVE	 Like, sure it has cheap cheap jokes
NEGATIVE	 But it wasn't that great
NEUTRAL	 Like seriously like (umm) (uhh) xxx (stutter) In the beginning they had like, there's a child like, as a seeing who which child can (uhh) get along and it was Shrek and you're like what the heck, that's pretty funny
NEUTRAL	 Ha ha ha, but after awhile you're just like, oh okay
NEGATIVE	 And it's just like three hundred, but weirder and not, like they tried to be funny
POSITIVE	 You have to admit that
NEGATIVE	 But it's not that great, so I highly do not recommend you to watch Meet The Spartans
NEUTRAL	 (stutter) It has a British guy from (uhh) Off Center and also in other (stutter) like movies
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) He also (uhh) was in (stutter) NYPD Blue like blue city and such
NEGATIVE	 And like (umm) Well Meet the Spartans is a very cheap knock off
NEGATIVE	 It wasn't that great, it was really bad
NEGATIVE	 (stutter) It was spent a whole bunch of money on it, but it wasn't that great
NEGATIVE	 Some (stutter) like people expected it to be great because of three hundred but it wasn't
NEGATIVE	 Like it was pretty offensive
NEUTRAL	 The things like like (stutter) the fight scene
NEUTRAL	Hi, I'm going to review for you today the DVD of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider
NEGATIVE	 This is not a very good movie at all, but if you like the video game Tomb Raider it's based on that and that was one of my very favorite favorite video games ever, and so of course I had to get the movie
POSITIVE	 But the DVD has special edition stuff so if you wanna see (uhh) behind the scenes and things like that
NEUTRAL	 So if you can find it for cheap, buy it
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The plot in it's really bad
NEGATIVE	 The acting's not that great
NEUTRAL	 It's fun to watch (umm) (uhh) Angeline Jolie be Tomb Raider, but I mean it's not really not that interesting
NEUTRAL	 There's a lot of action and fighting and shooting, but the bad guy's not even that bad, I think
NEGATIVE	 He's just does a typical overacting sort of job
NEGATIVE	 (umm) If you can find it for cheap and you like Tomb Raider that would be a good thing to get it, but don't pay over five dollars for this
NEGATIVE	 It's not really worth it
POSITIVE	 (umm) If you can see it on TV for free that's good too
NEUTRAL	Hello Expo, this is my video review for the movie Meet the Spartans
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I came into the movie with very low expectations
NEUTRAL	 Cuz like I was expecting like, I was gonna stare at wallpaper kind of movie
NEGATIVE	 And but there were some scenes that were, that went over the top with trying to make it humorous by, and, (stutter) it ended up just being disturbing or disgusting
NEUTRAL	 And (uhh) lucky for me I have a way to like, shut that off like, if I know like a really horrible scene's gonna come up I'm just gonna like, go into my zone
NEUTRAL	 Or whatever
NEGATIVE	 And I give this movie a two out of five because it's a bad movie, that's no surprise
NEGATIVE	 Even if you haven't seen the movie you should know it's a bad movie
POSITIVE	 But it's not as bad as I thought it would be
NEUTRAL	 You know
NEGATIVE	 Like, I knew it wasn't gonna be good
NEUTRAL	 Since the trailer
NEGATIVE	 I heard that people thought it was gonna be like, really hilariously funny and they're not really smart
NEUTRAL	 If they thought that way
NEGATIVE	 And I watched it because I had nothing else better to do
NEGATIVE	 Anyway, (umm) the movie is a parody of three hundred and a parody of other (stutter) movies and celebrities like Shrek, little bit of Happy Feet, You Got Served
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Paris Hilton and other stuff
NEUTRAL	 And (umm) there were probably two or three things that were kind of entertaining for me which is a surprise cuz I expected much of my expectations were much lower than two or three laughs
POSITIVE	Hello expotv land
POSITIVE	 It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you today about the movie currently in theaters Meet the Spartans
NEUTRAL	 I just don't know
NEGATIVE	 These people seem to not have anything else to do with their time
NEGATIVE	 I just don't like it and I hope they don't keep on making more like this
NEGATIVE	 And I don't know (stutter) why I did, but I went to this movie cause I knew I would hate it, cause I hate all movies like this
NEGATIVE	 Like exactly what the Scary Movies have become, the last three-hundred they made, and things like The Comebacks
NEGATIVE	 They're just all these lame attempts that just keep on referencing movies over and over and they're just not even funny
NEGATIVE	 Like, they just have, I just don't know how they come up with them, they're not funny
NEUTRAL	 Meet the Spartans was just the same way
NEGATIVE	 (umm) They're talking about the Three-Hundred and really they just keep on bringing up things that aren't funny
NEGATIVE	 They're all trying to make this topical humor like Britney Spears, just all this ridiculous stuff that doesn't make sense and isn't, just not funny
NEGATIVE	 I don't know why they keep on making these kinds movie and I just hope they don't make more movies like this, cause Three-Hundred just came out last year and they already made a parody of it
NEUTRAL	Hello Expo TV
NEGATIVE	 Tonight I would like to share with you Men Seeking Women, starring Will Ferrel and a couple other horribly unfunny people
NEGATIVE	 It made me sick to my stomach
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Like I said it's cheap, I think it runs like five bucks which is why I picked it up, I should of known better
NEGATIVE	 But (uhh) consider this a warning to avoid Men Seeking Women
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Will Ferrel the parts that I watched you know he's kind of funny but the writing in it's terrible and they don't really give him much to work with and it seems like he kind of may have had a jerk director that wouldn't let him you know do his thing and experiment and play around and be as (uhh) (uhh) improvious as he would want to be
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) I highly advise you stay as far away (uhh) from this movie as you can
NEGATIVE	 It's one of those things where a company has a movie with someone in it and they realize that person is now famous so they pull it out and put it on DVD to trick people into buying it because it has someone they love, being Will Ferrel
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It has him right there on the cover, (uhh) twice, in the picture and standing here
NEGATIVE	 He's all over the back, because no one else cares about the other people in this movie
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It has the little smarmy glasses wearing guy from Murphy Brown
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It's just not awesome
POSITIVE	 It's about these best friends and there's something about them trying to get married in a certain amount of time
NEGATIVE	 I honestly can't even tell you that I watched the movie all the way through
POSITIVE	What's up guys I am going to review a movie that I think and actually many people agree with me (uhh) critics and fans alike that is one of or maybe the best war movie (umm) ever made and it's called Saving Private Ryan it stars Tom Hank's of course (umm) Matt Damon and a cast of others including Vin Diesel if you're a fan of his and it's about (umm) you know a setting in World War Two and a mother who has lost three of her four sons in the war, so there is one squadron's mission to go and find the fourth son whose name is Private Ryan (umm) the movie goes through that it goes through the realities of war and World War Two what happened there and what happened to them (umm) It's seen through the eyes of these soldiers you know they question their orders they don't understand why they have to risk their life (umm) Ryan questions his orders he just wants to stay and fight for his country (umm) and really just goes through their struggles of your your (stutter) everyday you know American soldier in World War Two, and it's poignant and it's beautiful, and you know it won five academy awards including best director Steven Spielberg of course you know it's hailed by everybody Time Magazine, USA Today, New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, (umm) it won best picture award at the the (stutter) Toronto broadcast film critic special
NEUTRAL	Hi guys
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Today I'll be talking about the movie Semi-Pro
NEUTRAL	 (umm) This movie is the latest release (umm) in which Will Ferrell is the main leading character
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Supposed to be a comedy movie but it's not much comedy
NEGATIVE	 I enjoyed Will Ferrell's last movie Blades of Glory but this movie's (umm) not up to that mark of comedy
NEUTRAL	 (umm) In this movie (umm) Will Ferrell is the coach and the star player of the American Basketball Association team
NEUTRAL	 (umm) The name of the team was the Tropics and then (umm) and there was a competition if their team xxx xxx xxx that then their team would be totally (umm) like moshed into some other team
NEUTRAL	 So, he basically had to push all all (stutter) of his players to play a good nice game
NEGATIVE	 But (umm) mean, it it (stutter) was (umm) not that interesting movie
NEGATIVE	 So, (umm) I'm probably gonna give this movie (umm) like two out of five
NEUTRAL	Hello, Will here and today I'll be reviewing Charlie's Angels
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) This is not the full throttle version, this is the first one
POSITIVE	 And it's pretty good
NEGATIVE	 I wouldn't go out and say, you know, go out of your way and buy it, but if you like (uhh) Drew Barrymore and Carmen Diaz's acting, and Lucy Liu, go out and buy it
NEGATIVE	 Otherwise it's not really worth the price
NEUTRAL	 (umm) It was okay
NEUTRAL	 It didn't really (umm) reflect the series as well as everyone thought it should have, if you're a fan of the Charlie's Angels TV series
NEGATIVE	 I mean, the the (stutter) people elements are there, it's just not really the same, so (umm) I don't know, with special features and all I would say you know, don't go out and get it
NEGATIVE	 (umm) If you're going go out and get you know, you get this one and full throttle which is the second Charlie's Angels (umm) together for cheap, go ahead but don't bother
NEUTRAL	Hey y'all
NEUTRAL	 It's the king of movies here and today I'm going to (stutter) review Step Up Two the Streets which is a new movie in theaters
NEGATIVE	 It's it's (stutter) that kind of movie where they just stretch it out with an unnecessary plot that's formulaic and (stutter) try to turn it into a movie and it it (stutter) ultimately fails in in (stutter) the sense of a movie
NEGATIVE	 Wouldn't recommend seeing it in theaters (umm) just because the plot and stuff like that is all just regurgitated and (stutter) formulaic
NEUTRAL	 Instead (uhh) watch the dance scenes
NEGATIVE	 Hopefully one day, when the DVD comes out or something, you'll be able to just easily watch it on youtube or (uhh) rent it even, just to see the dance scenes because the rest of the movie is just there kind of to fill up space and make it ninety minute, minute (stutter) (uhh) feature length
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) So if you're, so that's (uhh) Step Up Two the Streets
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) If you're interested in dancing you might maybe check it out
NEGATIVE	 If you have, if you hate dancing there's no point in even checking this out really cause the plot sucks and (uhh) the dancing is only there for people that enjoy dancing
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It's a teen, teen kind of drama about (stutter) {burp} excuse me, dancing
POSITIVE	 (uhh) If you're interested at all in dancing (uhh) like (stutter) street, excuse me, street style dancing (uhh) like (uhh) (stutter) You Got Served and that kind of dancing you might enjoy this film
NEUTRAL	 (umm) I thought it was pretty formulaic and (uhh) just like typical teen melodrama stuff that we've been seeing (uhh) for the last several years
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Just like regurgitated stuff
POSITIVE	 However I must admit that the choreographed dance scenes are (uhh) quite a sight to see and they're really top notch
POSITIVE	 If you're a fan of dancing in that sense, just like to watch people dance, see impressive dance moves then you might want to check out this movie solely for that
NEGATIVE	 The actual plot, however, is formulaic and not really worth seeing
NEUTRAL	 It's kind of one of those movies where (uhh) it's stretched out to ninety minutes just to be a full length movie but it would have been perfectly fine just showing the the (stutter) choreographed (uhh) dance scenes, like a ten minute short or like something on TV, or even just like put someone put up a clip on youtube of just people dancing
NEUTRAL	Hey, ExpoTV
NEUTRAL	 Today I'm here to talk about the movie Boarding Gate
NEGATIVE	 (umm) So a completely ridiculous story
NEGATIVE	 (umm) No value in watching this at all
NEGATIVE	 You don't learn anything from this movie
NEUTRAL	 You don't get a good feeling afterwards
NEGATIVE	 (umm) After watching it, I just felt a little bit sick, a little bit disgusted, like why did I just waste my time watching that? (umm) So I think most people would get that feeling after seeing this
NEGATIVE	 Like I said, there's really nothing that sticks out that would be even remotely good about this movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Even the acting is poor
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Watching this movie is probably one of the biggest wastes of my time (umm) in recent memory
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I should have known that going in, but I didn't listen
NEUTRAL	 (umm) What this movie is about is Asia Argento, who plays an ex-prostitute
NEUTRAL	 (umm) And she's forced (umm) to flee England, (umm) London (umm) after a {sigh} bad encounter (umm) during one of her jobs
NEGATIVE	 And (uhh), as you can tell, the movie is already completely ridiculous and not something you want to watch
NEUTRAL	 (umm) But she's forced to flee, and she takes up with a different couple
NEUTRAL	 And, you know, they promise to get her her (stutter) passport, her visa, all the necessary papers (umm) obviously in exchange for services
NEUTRAL	 (umm) And it basically turns out to be a manipulation on the couple's end against Sandra
NEUTRAL	Hi, today I'm going to do a movie currently in theaters for view for you of a movie called ten thousand B
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Number one, you've got you know pyramids being built, you've got vultures on like mammoths and you've got people of different kinds of (umm) races sometimes, it's just like ten thousand B
NEGATIVE	, this is not probable
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It's not true and (umm) the movie is really terrible
NEGATIVE	 They don't develop into the characters at all
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Throughout the duration of the movie I don't feel a sense to any of the characters
NEGATIVE	 And also the acting is just some of the worst acting I've ever seen
NEGATIVE	 And If I could say this (umm) {laugh} just save your money
NEGATIVE	 Save your eight, nine, ten dollars
NEGATIVE	 Whatever the movie rate is in your city and do not go see ten thousand B
NEUTRAL	 (umm) ten thousand B
NEGATIVE	 There's probably a lot of other movies playing right now that you would enjoy more than ten thousand B
NEGATIVE	 So again, (umm) this is my review for ten thousand B
NEUTRAL	 is about (umm) you know, it takes place in ten thousand B
POSITIVE	 (umm) A prehistoric culture (umm) and it kind of revolves around a young man who is hunting mammoths and (umm) trying to save his tribe
NEGATIVE	 This movie though, this movie is absolutely awful
NEGATIVE	 I (umm) I couldn't recommend this to anybody
NEGATIVE	 There's all kinds of things going around that don't seem to actually make any sense,(umm) especially in regards to historical accuracy
NEUTRAL	Hey, ExpoTV
NEUTRAL	 This is Aubs eighty four and today I'm going to talk to you about the movie The Wedding Director
POSITIVE	 (umm) In typical foreign film fashion, it was all about character development, and all about the background story and getting to know people
NEGATIVE	 And, you know, generally I don't mind that
NEGATIVE	 But when it's, in terms of this movie it was just so pointless and didn't seem to go anywhere and was just kind of a big circle of ridiculousness actually
NEUTRAL	 (umm) The basic plot of the story is that this guy, Franco, is a film maker and he's worried about (uhh) getting his daughter married to this extremist religious guy who's kind of crazy
NEUTRAL	 So he's all whipped up about that and all of a sudden this scandal breaks loose and Franco's forced to flee his country
NEUTRAL	 He has to leave (umm) because he's kind of been indicted for some things
NEGATIVE	 He's not looking very good
NEGATIVE	 He's not gonna be making any more movies anytime soon in his homeland
POSITIVE	 (umm) So he leaves and in his new city, he ends up being there and he meets this guy who finds out he's a film director and says, well can you film my daughter's wedding And Franco says, sure, I'll do that
NEUTRAL	 And basically what happens is he's filming the wedding and he falls in love with this woman who's getting married
NEUTRAL	 (umm) This is a foreign film
NEUTRAL	 So it's kind of, it's all out there
NEGATIVE	 It's a little bit ridiculous with the extremist religious thing at the beginning and then the scandal and then falling in love with the girl
NEGATIVE	 And it kind of doesn't really fit together
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I think any one of those three things could have been it's own separate movie and it would've been a better production, rather than trying to ravel all three of these things into one long, drawn-out and ridiculous film
POSITIVE	 I think it would be enough to swallow (umm) the whole scandal thing
NEUTRAL	 And I can't, I can't (stutter) even go into all the detail around the scandal thing because it's so in-depth
NEGATIVE	 And so (umm) convoluted and messy
NEUTRAL	 You just kind of have to watch the movie and read the subtitles for yourself (umm) in order to figure it all out
NEGATIVE	 And even for myself, I still wonder if I got the whole thing right
NEGATIVE	 It's that messy
NEUTRAL	 (umm) It's set in France and it's definitely subtitled
NEGATIVE	 (umm) And that was my least favorite part about the movie was that scandal and the huge shebang that happened because of it
NEGATIVE	 It, it (stutter) could have been simplified or done as it's own movie where you can spend the time getting into and really explaining and delving into the whole situation
NEGATIVE	 (umm) When you try to combine it into a whole other movie like it was done in this one, it's just to much to digest
NEGATIVE	 It would have took me another two or three viewings (uhh) just to to (stutter) figure this out
NEGATIVE	 And I don't think any movie should be that complex or that complicated, foreign or not
NEGATIVE	 I mean entertainment value here is what I want and that's not what I was given in this film at all
NEGATIVE	 I'm only gonna give it a one out of five rating
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I can't think of anything (uhh) for the movie as a whole that would have increased that rating
NEUTRAL	 (umm) If they would've broken it up I mean, then it's just different films so you can't even, it's comparing apples to oranges kind of
NEGATIVE	 (umm) But that would've been a better alternative to what they did here
NEGATIVE	 So if you're not a fan of sub-titles, you're gonna want to steer clear of this one
POSITIVE	 (umm) I I've (stutter) seen some foreign film lately that I really enjoyed
POSITIVE	 I really got into the story line and really felt part of these characters
NEGATIVE	 But this one was kind of fantastical and weird and out there and just not worth my time
NEGATIVE	 Again, one out of five stars
NEGATIVE	 Don't waste your time seeing it in a theater
NEGATIVE	 Don't even waste your time renting this one
NEGATIVE	 It's just not worth it
NEGATIVE	 (umm) If you don't mind subtitles and you're into foreign films, I would still say don't get your hopes up
NEGATIVE	 It's just, it really isn't that good
NEGATIVE	 Honestly, I was bored out of my mind and couldn't wait for this film to be over
NEGATIVE	 It was long
NEGATIVE	 It it (stutter) drew on and on
NEUTRAL	What's up expo tv
NEUTRAL	 I have a movie review for Superhero Movie
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) He goes off and fights crime against like this guy called the hourglass
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Not that good of a movie as I said
NEGATIVE	 It could have been a lot better
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It's like one of the most stupid comedies, like you don't really laugh that much, but, but (stutter) you laugh at some parts but as soon as it ends you're like, I just wasted like, ninety minutes of my life and like like (stutter) ten dollars
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) So I really don't recommend seeing it
NEGATIVE	 Don't see it in the theaters
NEGATIVE	 Do not see it on dvd
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Just completely ignore like this movie
NEGATIVE	 I don't get how these movies get put in like like (stutter) theaters, or like production even
NEGATIVE	 Like who wants to do this
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) Currently in theaters
NEUTRAL	 It's about ninety minutes long and it's rated PG-thirteen for (uhh) crude and sexual content, comic violence, drug references, language
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It's from the makers of Scary Movie but this one's rated PG-thirteen
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) I guess so more people can see it
NEGATIVE	 It it's (stutter) not as good as the original Scary Movie, and it's not as good as pretty much any spoof movie
NEGATIVE	 I thought it was kind of bad
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) I guess the movie's about how (uhh) how this kid named Rick gets bitten by this dragonfly and and (stutter) he becomes known as, like the dragonfly because he gets all these like, superpowers like he gets I guess like, he gets really strong, his skin gets like tough
NEUTRAL	 And (uhh) it's just like I guess like (stutter) spoof on spiderman and pretty much every other superhero (stutter) movie that's currently out
NEGATIVE	Hello Expo TV
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Today I'm reviewing the movie Death Race
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Honestly that sounds pretty stupid
NEGATIVE	 I don't even know why I saw it
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) But at least now you guys are warned
NEGATIVE	 Don't see Death Race
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) I wouldn't even rent it
NEGATIVE	 It's really pretty bad
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) I mean, there's a lot of action
NEUTRAL	 If you like senseless action, Death Race is your movie
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) This means two out of five
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It really wasn't very good
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) It stars Jason Statham
NEUTRAL	 You might recognize him from the Crank movies, where he was like a getaway driver kind of, drug runner
NEGATIVE	 Anyways, (umm) where do I start? (umm) The movie takes place in two thousand twelve
NEUTRAL	 It's about a guy that goes to prison for a crime he didn't commit
NEUTRAL	 It's a like, for profit prison where they have this pay-per-view creation that's these death races and they have convicts racing in like cars with all kinds of crazy stuff like missiles and flamethrowers and machine guns and they kill each other and if you win, it's five races, you get your freedom
NEUTRAL	 So, that's kind of the premise of the movie
NEUTRAL	I am reviewing shop girl
NEUTRAL	 Has Steve Martin, Claire Danes, and Jason Jason (stutter) Schwartzman and (umm) the movie is rated R
NEGATIVE	 But he has issues and the young guy has issues and there's a lot of sex in it and it's, it's just not a movie at all that I would recommend
POSITIVE	 And it is described as a cute romantic comedy on the back
NEGATIVE	 I would not recommend this movie at all {laughter}
NEUTRAL	 It is based on a short novel or novella written by Steve Martin
NEUTRAL	 And so I had these expectations that this movie would be along the lines of (umm) Roxanne or (umm) You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, Never Been Kissed, that kind of cute romantic comedy
NEUTRAL	 It is, to me very dark
NEUTRAL	 (umm) It's actually a little odd
NEUTRAL	 It's this girl (umm) basically is kinda torn between these two guys
NEUTRAL	 A young guy that's not going anywhere and a rich older entrepreneur who's Steve Martin
POSITIVE	Hello, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Traitor, which I went and saw last night
NEUTRAL	 As formality, here is my movie ticket
NEGATIVE	 It's a really bad spy movie cause it really feels like there's no real story to it
NEGATIVE	 There's the investigation element, but that's it
NEGATIVE	 You know, what's the story, what's the point
NEGATIVE	 There is none
NEGATIVE	 That's the flaw of this movie
NEGATIVE	 The script was written as sort of a, sub-element
NEGATIVE	 You know, it's missing the greater story to which the script plugs in to
NEGATIVE	 And, that's why I can't give this movie anything more than a one out of five, cause it was atrocious
NEGATIVE	 And this isn't worth seeing at all, cause I mean, come on, you can come up with better spy movies than this
NEUTRAL	 There are so many
NEUTRAL	 And there it went
NEUTRAL	 And I mean, not necessarily like spy like, James Bond, but counter, like you know, investigation spy movies
NEGATIVE	 There are so many better ones to be doing
NEGATIVE	 So, I have to say, one out of five
NEGATIVE	 This was horrible
NEGATIVE	 The premise is barely there at all
NEGATIVE	 It's like a quarter of a movie but running the full length
NEGATIVE	 Which is bad because the actors do a good job, but that cannot save it from being an atrocious pile of junk
NEGATIVE	 So, one out five for Traitor
NEGATIVE	 So, Traitor is a movie about (uhh), it's a basic spy movie
NEGATIVE	 The premise here is really not good in any way, shape, or form
NEGATIVE	 But I will try to hack it together for you
NEUTRAL	 So, this (uhh), sort of, straight-laced FBI dude is investigating (uhh), a bunch of crazy stuff that happened
NEUTRAL	 And it turns out that this other sort of counter intelligence dude for the US, (uhh) is always seems to be connected to all of it
NEUTRAL	 So, it's, he has to figure out what's going on and why this is happening and is person number two involved with this, and is he a good guy or a bad guy, is the people is coming to help him investigate and are they good or bad is there other interests in here
NEUTRAL	 That's the premise
NEUTRAL	Hi there
NEGATIVE	 I just returned from the theater and I saw this really really bad movie called (umm) Beer for My Horses and like I said, did I mention that it was bad? Well it was bad
NEGATIVE	 I mean I wouldn't recommend you watch it, cause it was bad enough that I watched it one time
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) I wouldn't see it at the theater and I wouldn't rent it either
NEGATIVE	 I'd just try to forget about it
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Kinda like it was a bad dream, you know
NEGATIVE	 Just forget it had ever happened
NEUTRAL	 But (umm) that's my opinion anyway
NEGATIVE	 It has Tom Skerrit in it, (uhh) that's not a reflection on him cause he's actually a good actor, it's got Toby Keith, who he's a country music singer and if you're listening to country music that's fine but he really shouldn't be acting, and it's also got (uhh) Ted Nugent
NEGATIVE	 He's a former (umm) rock singer or whatever but he's not really an actor either
NEGATIVE	 So I mean you're you're (stutter) putting these people together to make this really bad movie and I guess that's what you're gonna get
NEUTRAL	 It's rated PG-thirteen
NEUTRAL	 The premise of it is there's these two deputies that are trying to do something
NEUTRAL	 The sheriff doesn't really want them to do it but they do it anyway
NEUTRAL	 So they take this road trip and that's kind of how the movie goes
NEGATIVE	 and like I said, you watch it for yourself and see what you think
NEUTRAL	Some Boards have provision for committee members to serve who are not full Board members, not voting members of the Board.
NEUTRAL	So you may not have all of the skills and abilities that you need for the audit committee on your full voting Board members but you among your committee members that expertise.
NEUTRAL	Student affairs academic affairs, that's another area where you may have some non-Board members serving.
NEUTRAL	For instance, we don't necessarily recommend the students serve as voting members of the Board because of conflict of interest concerns, but students could be a wonderful asset on the student affairs committee and can serve as full members of the committee and vote on proposals that will come before the Board but aren't voting as full Board members when the resolutions of the Board are passed.
NEUTRAL	Faculty member similarly could serve that way on an academic affairs committee; great opportunity to expand the interaction between Board members, faculty and students and enrich the discussion of those committees with the kinds of perspectives that you need in committee work.
NEGATIVE	Hi, my name is Logan and this piece of dog crap is The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
NEUTRAL	 This (uhh) stars Sean Connery
NEGATIVE	 It was an excuse to get Sean Connery into a James Bondish role without being James Bond cause they didn't want to pay for that and he (stutter) shoots people and he acts like oh I'm Sean Connery {mumble} you gotta shoot people, this is how you do it
NEGATIVE	 I can't do a very (stutter) good Sean Connery voice but this was really lame movie
NEGATIVE	 I mean, come on Sean, can't do you do better than that? (stutter) It's just {sigh}
NEGATIVE	 It's like he was really hurting for money so he picked the first script that came along
NEGATIVE	 It's just a horrible, stupid movie
NEGATIVE	 It doesn't make a lot of sense
NEGATIVE	 The action sequences are sometimes way too long and sometimes they're too short and it just, it jumps around, it's like oh he's going to his, you know, his (uhh) his castle of fortressness, we have to go get him
NEGATIVE	 So they go up into the mountains or something after the bad guy
NEGATIVE	 It's like how do they know he was there? Why did he go there? That's like the first place you would think he would go, why would you I don't know
NEGATIVE	 It was a really dull story line, it doesn't make a lot of sense
NEGATIVE	 It's just so stupid
NEGATIVE	 Don't get this movie
NEGATIVE	 It's from the director of Blade, that should have told me in the first place cause Blade sucked, this sucks
NEGATIVE	 Don't rent it, don't buy it, don't waste your time
NEUTRAL	 (umm) It's set in like the eighteen hundreds and it's like fantasy and (uhh) you know, the (stutter) first of all the main star, or the main guy in (stutter), there's like all these like Captain Nemo's in it and then other people, other famousishy people from around that time were in it
NEUTRAL	 I have never heard of Alan Quartermain
NEGATIVE	 I don't know what they were thinking when they decided that Sean Connery should star as Alan Quartermain
NEGATIVE	 It doesn't make any sense but (uhh) I don't know
NEGATIVE	 It it's (stutter) pretty dumb
NEUTRAL	 There's like a vampire in it, an invisible guy, Captain Nemo, a guy that can't die cause he's like he starts out as a good guy and then he goes to a bad guy
NEGATIVE	 It's really just a dull story line
POSITIVE	Hey
NEUTRAL	 ExpoTV I am DJ Mel here and I will be reviewing myself, no I am not so why did I tell you my name? Anyways, today I am reviewing (stutter) Denzel Washington's Deja Vu
POSITIVE	 This movie is, this movie is PG thirteen, thirteen, yes (umm) (uhh) This is starring touched, no (stutter) that's not him I'm sorry (uhh) it is (uhh) brought to you by Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Touchstone Pictures
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I would've, I watched this movie once, four years ago for something, didn't really like it, it's (stutter) suspenseful but, meaningless at the same time and it has a confusing plot so if you're looking for a good watch, like a classic watch like you're going to watch an old movie, (umm) and you're you're (stutter) looking for an action or a suspense movie, don't get Deja Vu, you'll get like Shanghai Knights
POSITIVE	 Just any Jackie Chan movie will do
NEGATIVE	 So {laughter} anyways, this this (stutter) not a great movie, so yeah, don't watch it
NEUTRAL	Hi expo
NEUTRAL	 Today I'd like to do a movie review for you of a movie that's currently in theaters so I have my ticket stub for here, and that's Bride Wars
NEGATIVE	 So I don't give it a good review
NEUTRAL	 Bride Wars
NEUTRAL	 Bride Wars is a movie starring (umm) Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway as Liv and Emma who are two girls who are best friends who get engaged at about the same time and (umm) they're plan to do everything together, being each other's maids of honor, et cetera et cetera
NEUTRAL	 And they both want to get married at the same place until they find out that only one of them can get married at the Plaza
NEUTRAL	 (umm) And a small war between them begins (umm) because they both just (umm) don't want to make any compromises
NEGATIVE	 This movie (umm) if you saw previews for it it looks kind of funny, but this movie actually wasn't very funny
NEGATIVE	 It was very (umm) average, very predictable, and the acting wasn't that great
NEGATIVE	 (umm) And you know I really do like to see fluffy chick flicks sometimes so I'm not against that but this one was pretty terrible
NEGATIVE	 And I definitely recommend that if you're considering going to see Bride Wars that you save your money because it's not that good
NEGATIVE	 So if you're looking for a movie to see with your girlfriends on a Friday night or a fluffy chick flick I would not recommend seeing Bride Wars because it's not what you expect, it's not worth the money, and it's not that good
NEUTRAL	Hello and welcome to my review of Pinata, Survival Island
NEUTRAL	 This is a story of a bunch of college students who go to an island for (umm) a treasure hunt
NEUTRAL	 So if that gives you any indication of where this movie is going, (umm) if that doesn't I don't know what will
NEUTRAL	 So this is Pinata, Survival Island
NEUTRAL	 And they end up breaking this ancient pinata which releases some demon and then of course, chaos ensues
NEGATIVE	 This movie is pretty bad
NEGATIVE	 It is (umm) {laugh} it's less than a B movie
NEGATIVE	 The only reason to see this is (umm) if you are a fan of Jaime Pressly or Nicholas Brandon, (umm) those are the two stars
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) Jaime Pressly of course from My Name Is Earl fame and Nicholas Brendon from Buffy the Vampire Slayer
NEGATIVE	 Only reason why the, to really to see this movie
NEGATIVE	 The special features there aren't very many, there's a feature commentary and some other junk but who who (stutter) really cares because this movie is pretty bad
NEUTRAL	 (umm) I I (stutter) have to mention that on the back of the dvd it actually says evil has gone wack
POSITIVE	You know, for the last few days I've been trying to think of words to describe how it feels to be on the other side of APH's Annual Meeting from teacher, O&amp;M, CLVT, and user of products, to EOT in two different states and and now to APH employee
POSITIVE	 And I guess the first thing I'd like to say it was really cool to celebrate my birthday with over 300 of my favorite people, so thank you very much for that
POSITIVE	 They make it look so easy, don't they? Chaired by Jaine Blome, guided by Craig Meador, and supported expertly by Jane Thompson and Scott Blome, as well as dozens of behind-the-scenes folks, you know who you are
POSITIVE	 This event has once again been seamlessly executed, serving as a needed antithesis to the current presidential campaign
POSITIVE	 &lt;&lt;Laughter&gt;&gt; Now that's something to be thankful for
POSITIVE	 &lt;&lt;Laughter&gt;&gt; As you head back out into the Year of Braille, I hope you'll feel like your trunk is straight and strong, your roots run deeper, and your branches reach a little farther to your colleagues and friends across this great country
POSITIVE	 Travel safely and we'll see you next year
POSITIVE	 But you know, I was wondering was I was I like a proud mama and I thought no, that would insinuate that I had a hand in shaping this amazing organization and event and I'm really much to new at APH to claim that, so I settled instead on Auntie as in "Auntie Dorinda is so proud to be part of this organization and event and the deep roots and branches we build
NEGATIVE	" The depth of my feelings go way beyond that though to all of you
POSITIVE	 I'm so grateful to all of you who traveled to Louisville and I know that you left overflowing email boxes that continued to overflow while you were here
POSITIVE	 And you left piles of work and you came here to participate in related meetings and in product sessions and our new roundtable discussions and I'm really glad to hear that you enjoyed those
POSITIVE	 I'm hoping we're going to continue that in the future
POSITIVE	 And then of course the many celebrations and then the hallway conversations that we all enjoy so much
POSITIVE	 I'm thankful for your day-to-day work making strides in improving the lives of the individuals that we serve
POSITIVE	 I'm thankful for the APH staff who have worked tirelessly to put on this event
NEUTRAL	The test we're using costs forty dollars, at a local pharmacy and there's no need to pay eighty dollars for two, when you could have done it with one.
NEGATIVE	The test can only be used on urine, you're not going to be able to test blood or saliva or any other bodily fluids, so there's really no point in using anything but urine.
NEUTRAL	"th" is quite similar to "s" But with "th" my tongue is in between my top and my bottom teeth like this "th".   If I say "s" you can’t see my tongue If I say "th" you can see my tongue a little bit between my teeth.
NEGATIVE	Scott Reed talking: Some people in the community as the game has become more, um, more regarded . . . have raised the concerns about how we as graduate students have absorbed a lot of cost in producing the game and um . . . trust me, it concerns us too.
NEUTRAL	There’s a lot of real labor; there’s a lot of real capital that goes into the game.
POSITIVE	We were lucky early on thanks to Doug Eyman to get some funding through Cengage; there wasn’t a very formal process to it.
POSITIVE	We just asked if they were interested, and they helped us defray some of the costs.
NEUTRAL	I think in any given year, we’re looking at roughly $1,500 or so in terms of the cost of actually putting on the game.
POSITIVE	And our sponsor, and having Cengage sponsor us has been . . . has helped.
NEUTRAL	Um, this year we’re switching up how we approach funding, and we’re hopefully going to be able to arrange for some sustainable, more officially recognized sorts of funding.
NEUTRAL	I was a victim of a horrible crime when I was young, and went on after that to a career as a defense attorney, and understand that no matter what the crime is, there needs to be a just process.
NEGATIVE	But when I put myself in these situations and I see a Nazi camp guard killing Jewish people in the morning before breakfast, in my mind's eye.
NEGATIVE	Or I see what happened in the Rwandan genocide, with the slamming of babies against the walls of churches, you know, of families seeing their own children killed in front of their eyes, and other loved ones.
NEGATIVE	And I see the brutality and the animus in the eyes of the people doing those crimes.
POSITIVE	We are now inside the main auditorium, where family and friends will witness the entire event - what a fanatic view their are treated too today
NEUTRAL	up outside of the IDI exhibition last fall, and on that table there is a sign that reads: Congratulations to Irish designers for making an impact with universal design
NEUTRAL	That brings us to tonight, the Universal Design Grand Challenge
NEUTRAL	You have to pay a small consulting fee $150 to $400 and then you can work out some sort of arrangement where you pay a small amount of money or maybe you give that attorney for a little less money, a couple of points or ownership in the film.
POSITIVE	But figure out a way where you have a little bit of legal advice for the film as the process develops.
NEUTRAL	But our next topic here is what is the next step that you take for a first time producer?
NEUTRAL	I'm Don Varney of Varney Speaks and on behalf of Expert Village.
POSITIVE	Professionally, give yourself the best opportunity to get the job once you've done a good job on your interview.
POSITIVE	Get a special phone, special email, get your family aware of what's going on, take the entry level job if that's what it takes, and just have yourself a great interview processing.
POSITIVE	The other thing that you get to do is you get to choose your name, so why not put your name.
POSITIVE	For over 10 years HOCK international has offered high-quality CIA study materials in English, and now in partnership with Al-Joman Consultancy in Amman, Jordan, (Sarh Al-Joman Training) we are pleased to offer our high-quality CIA Textbooks in Arabic.
POSITIVE	The Arabic Textbooks are not just a direct translation of the English materials - they were carefully translated by a team of experts who understand both English and Arabic.
POSITIVE	The CIA in Arabic materials are available to purchase on our web site at www.hockinternational.com or from Al-Joman Consultancy in Amman.
POSITIVE	Shipping is free to all Arabic-speaking countries, and orders are fulfilled from Amman for delivery in just a few days.
NEUTRAL	So, for example, they could say, "I only experience difficulty when there's background noise", "I only experience difficulty in meetings at work". So it can be very situation specific.
NEUTRAL	Hey, y'all, how's it going? My name is Jordan, and (uhh) today I'm gonna be reviewing the DVD Godzilla
POSITIVE	 Now, this movie well if you saw it, then you probably don't need to watch any more of this review
NEUTRAL	 I'm pretty sure
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Yeah
NEGATIVE	 He's the guy (umm) who's the big hero in the movie, and (umm) I don't think that he could really be a hero in a movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) He wasn't very good (umm) at you know trying to solve the big problems or anything like that
NEGATIVE	 (umm) The effects in this movie were not that great
NEGATIVE	 This was actually after Jurassic Park came out and (umm) in this movie, the effects look worse than Jurassic Park, so people went expecting, you know, (umm) you know, effects that would actually look better, but no, they didn't look nearly as good as Jurassic Park
NEUTRAL	 (umm) It actually looked kind of similar, it looks like they kind of copied some of the stuff from Jurassic Park, but (umm) as far as special features go, I mean it has a little bit of special features
NEGATIVE	 Not a whole lot, but it has like how they created you know, some of the (umm) some of the character, you know, CGI stuff, and everything like that, and how they destroyed a lot of the buildings and stuff like that, but I mean, the movie kind of just isn't that great, so I mean you probably don't wanna pick this DVD up because (umm) the movie's not that great, so you won't be that interested in the special features, so (umm) I'd skip over this one and (uhh) look for another one
NEUTRAL	 (umm) The movie kind of speaks for itself
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It's not really a great movie
POSITIVE	 Matthew Perry is actually Not Matthew Perry
NEUTRAL	 What's his name? I think his name is Matthew Perry
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) Matthew Perry
POSITIVE	 I think his name's Matthew Perry
POSITIVE	 It's the guy from Ferris Bueller's Day Off
NEUTRAL	 I think his name is Matthew Perry
NEUTRAL	Ernst &amp; Young's Fraud Investigation &amp; Disputes Services team has released research showing employees consider expense fraud as more serious than stealing physical company property (20%), drinking during work (13%) and breaching of licensing arrangements (10%). Unusual or lavish claims for expense reimbursements can also point to other types of fraud, including bribery.
NEGATIVE	But it totally went wrong
NEUTRAL	I saw a big red cross on a page like engraving the cross on my heart
NEGATIVE	Since the moment, it was too hard to smile for me
NEGATIVE	Many people asked me what happened, but I always replied them nothing and they just left
NEUTRAL	It was my first time to feel no one is on my side in the world
NEUTRAL	Maybe I can say it was one of the worst days in my life, but it changed to one of the best days in my life later
POSITIVE	One girl, who looks very chill, stayed beside me instead of saying something
NEUTRAL	She didn’t say anything but stayed until I left the school
POSITIVE	The one thing that really stands out is no matter which conference I attend, there seems to be very close to a consensus on many issues.
NEGATIVE	There are one or two dissenters here and there but generally whether it's the economy, the environment, or politics, people seem to agree that right now we are in a big crisis, and which is self evident of course, but also at this time it has really brought home to everyone that everything is interconnected.
POSITIVE	I also had a chance to watch some kids yesterday, especially I think some of the young speakers from Malawi, really made an impact.
NEUTRAL	And that solution is to build a green economy that's strong enough to lift people out of poverty.
NEUTRAL	You also should be thinking about how could we use the fact that we have all this work to be done now and doing it a different way to employ people maybe you haven't employed before.
NEUTRAL	We're going to adhere to the highest standards with regard to labor and with regard to the environment.
NEGATIVE	The governments of the world need to get on the side of the problem solvers in the world.
NEUTRAL	While both are two slightly different problems, there is one solution.
POSITIVE	And in this clip I want to cover getting digital cable or high definition cable into your HD TV set.
NEUTRAL	It'll come out of your wall into your box, out of the box into the TV, and you can look at connecting your cables into your TV in the other clips.
POSITIVE	If you have the other options, I would suggest using those to get the best signal out of your box and into your set to give you the best image possible.
NEUTRAL	Now with broadcast, you know when you're just receiving over the air, with an antenna, if you buy a TV that says High Definition tuner inside, that's what that's for.
NEUTRAL	Different cable systems encode their system channels a little differently, so you're going to have to get the box from them.
NEUTRAL	Now the cable box will come with the coax out that will go straight out of the coax box.
POSITIVE	Moody's did some excellent county by county progressive deterioration of the economy across the United States.
NEUTRAL	And so our ability to really blunt that, to get in the middle of that down at that very local level, in the store by store basis, were really critical for not just the retailer success, but everyone who puts stuff on a retail shelf.
NEUTRAL	Maybe some of the counties that went in early will come out early.
POSITIVE	But that's really, I think, where the local nature of the economy really comes to play for the marketer.
NEUTRAL	People need to save money because first of all that is what the constitution of the United States was built around.
NEUTRAL	Any great country out there saves, that is how the country is able to grow.
NEUTRAL	Marketing has a big influence on us because they are pushing every product out there we have to have in the newest and most fast form possible and we buy into that but the bottom line you need to save for your retirement.
POSITIVE	If you want to have a good retirement and be able to do whatever you want without working you have to save.
NEGATIVE	And, of course, student loans are notorious for being subsidized by the government as well.
POSITIVE	So the more a brand allows the consumer in, takes that feedback, and uses that to push it back out, a consumer receptive brand, I think brands will be more successful.
POSITIVE	It’s just an incredible … with this challenging environment, that the power and the motivations, and the leadership just generated from the speakers was just, it was very emotional.
POSITIVE	And I think that with the incredible members that we have in this organization, we’re ready.
POSITIVE	I want to be a Salvation Army officer because I really strongly believe that God has called me to officership.
POSITIVE	For me officership is not anything about me and what I can offer, but it's all about what God can do through somebody like me.
POSITIVE	It's all about me displaying His glory to other people so that they can also see how great God is.
POSITIVE	Hi Federationists! Lauren McLarney here with the Government Affairs team
POSITIVE	 I'm on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC
NEGATIVE	 Currently, over four-hundred thousand Americans with disabilities are being paid less than the minimum wage, some of them mere pennies per hour
NEUTRAL	 But the TIME Act will give nonprofit entities three years to transition their business model and ensure that all people with disabilities are paid the fair wages we deserve
POSITIVE	 It's time for people with disabilities to receive fair wages
NEUTRAL	 The second issue this year is the Technology, Education and Accessibility in College and Higher Education Act or the TEACH Act which works to address a problem facing far too many blind and otherwise print disabled students in college
NEUTRAL	 The print world is inherently inaccessible to blind people and electronic instructional materials like PDFs and learning management systems and ebooks
POSITIVE	 They offer the opportunity for blind students to use the exact same materials as their sighted peers and luckily the law actually requires that institutions of higher education provide equal access
NEGATIVE	 The problem is that requirement has no specifics, no criteria, no guidelines telling schools this is what accessibility looks like and this is what you should demand from the market
NEGATIVE	 Schools have no idea what to ask for, manufacturers aren't really embracing accessibility solutions and blind students are the ones that pay the price
POSITIVE	 The TEACH Act authorizes the creation of voluntary accessibility guidelines so this is what accessibility looks like, this is what you should demand from the market and then incentivizes schools to only use technology that conforms to those guidelines with a safe harbor from litigation
POSITIVE	 Our goal is to improve access for blind students, reduce litigation and stimulate an accessible digital marketplace
POSITIVE	 It's freezing! But I'm really excited because in two weeks we're going to do one of the coolest things that we do as an organization
NEUTRAL	 Hi, this is Scott LaBarre and I'm here to talk to you about the Marrakesh Treaty, what's also been called the "Book Treaty
NEUTRAL	" This year we are going before the United States Senate and urging them to ratify the Marrakesh Treaty
POSITIVE	 This would allow us to get books from all over the world in foreign languages and even in English that are already produced in Braille or other accessible formats
POSITIVE	 It will allow the rest of the world to get access to the collections we have here in the United States
POSITIVE	 We believe that the right to read, the right to information is a fundamental right and by ratifying Marrakesh we will secure a major victory in our right to read campaign
POSITIVE	 Now that you have all the details I hope you're as excited as I am
NEGATIVE	 Last year was an election year and a lot of people were complaining
POSITIVE	 They're part of the problem, but we're part of the process
POSITIVE	 500 Federationists are going to come here to DC and we're going to hike the hill together to tell our members of Congress about our legislative priorities and the things that we need to live the lives we want
NEUTRAL	 Our three legislative priorities this year are the Transitioning to Meaningful and Integrated Employment Act or the TIME Act, the Technology, Education and Accessibility in College and Higher Education Act or the TEACH Act and the Marrakesh Treaty
NEUTRAL	 Here are some more details about the three legislative priorities
POSITIVE	 I'm Rose Sloan and this year we are advocating for the Transitioning to Integrated and Meaningful Employment Act or the TIME Act
POSITIVE	 The title of the TIME Act explains exactly what we want nonprofits who hold Section 14(c) Certificates to do
NEUTRAL	 We want them to transition their business model to ensure that all people with disabilities, especially those being paid subminimum wages have the opportunity to transition into integrated and meaningful employment that they strive for

NEUTRAL	 It it (stutter) is a thriller (umm) he wants this woman, the woman is you know not interested in the guy so he finds a (uhh), I won't tell the story but he gets possession of this girl and then tries to take care and win her heart over, but (uhh) the story's (uhh) related to that
POSITIVE	 Watch this movie (umm) one time see, not bad
NEGATIVE	 DVD (uhh) I'm not sure if you'd want it in your collection, I won't suggest it though
POSITIVE	It's important to consider what other financing options you have available.
POSITIVE	Spending on your business, you might want to start seeking investment.
POSITIVE	Angel investors, venture capitalists, accelerators, and incubators all provide different opportunities to get the resources that you need.
POSITIVE	Let's look into who these investors are, and how they can help your business.

NEUTRAL	 (umm) They think he's too tough on the recruits and they think that he may have gotten some of them killed
NEGATIVE	 (umm) I did not care for this movie at all
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) The twists and the turns weren't really inspired or creative or (stutter) even interesting
NEGATIVE	 It just seemed like they came up with random things to happen that (uhh) I don't know
NEGATIVE	 It just, by the time you get to the end of the movie it felt like a waste of time to have watched any of it
NEUTRAL	Hi I'm reviewing Postmortem
NEGATIVE	 Starring (uhh) Charlie Sheen (umm) I guess now he's trying to take himself seriously since the box says, Charles Sheen, but (uhh) this is not a movie I would pick if I was Charles Sheen to launch my serious movie career
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) In the movie he plays a (uhh) serial killer profiler
NEGATIVE	 Which there are a million of in movies
NEUTRAL	 And he retires to become a novelist but he moves to a small town to get away from it all and it turns out that the small town has a serial killer so he has to help track him down
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It's not (uhh) a very good movie
NEGATIVE	 I didn't enjoy watching it, there's no special features
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) So it's a pretty poor DVD
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) Overall I really can't say anything positive about this, I wouldn't recommend watching it
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) I actually think it went straight to DVD
POSITIVE	As you are probably aware, even if you use the most advanced application-specific programs, the job of steel detailing is still labor-intensive.
POSITIVE	You must have heard about how there are a few Asian firms that do faultless detailing jobs for rates up to 40% less than those of their Western counterparts.
POSITIVE	Send us your detailing question through the form below, and if you don't get a reply in one business day, we will give you a 5% discount.
POSITIVE	If you would like to go to bed at eleven pm, go to bed at eleven pm every night of the week.
POSITIVE	It used to be when I was younger and I would give a speech, I could go into that room and I could tell stories and I could paint who I am based on the stories I painted in that room.
POSITIVE	Everybody needs a space where they can define themselves, and not be pre-defined by the information that exists about them.
NEUTRAL	In the old days, when we could control who had our information and what they could do with the information, we could truly as individuals police the market.
NEUTRAL	Any 22-year-old who lives on Facebook understands that the history of them as painted by their friends defines who they are with those they meet.
NEUTRAL	So I’ve been defined by the digital content that exists about me before I even give that speech.
NEUTRAL	So in the old days, I could define myself based on the stories that I told.
NEUTRAL	I wrote an article on “boxing”, and being boxed in by our information.
NEGATIVE	Kanabar has said that auditors and accountants are concerned that a conflict of interest amongst committee members would cause them to look at transactions unfairly.

NEGATIVE	MALE SPEAKER: I think of commercials and get annoyed, in general.
NEUTRAL	The Hills Have Eyes Two
NEUTRAL	 I enjoyed The Hills Have Eyes, the remake that came out a couple years ago and (umm) this is the sequel to it, of course
NEGATIVE	 I knew it was going to be bad
NEGATIVE	 I wanted to see it just to see it
NEUTRAL	 But I knew going in it was going to be bad and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It was still pretty bad, you know? Most of the people in the movie I didn't know
NEGATIVE	 (umm) A couple of the people I did, I knew who they were, but (umm) it (stutter) was a very bad movie
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Like I said, nuclear testing and then the army goes in to to (stutter) do stuff and then most of them get killed

NEUTRAL	 This time the army goes in there to test weapons and (umm) they go in there to to (stutter) do stuff, they have (umm) workers and stuff go in there, and (umm)
NEGATIVE	 So if you saw The Hills Have Eyes One you're probably thinking why not add soldiers? But (umm) it was it was a bad movie
NEGATIVE	 it wasn't the worst movie, and on a scale of one to ten I'd say it was probably a three
NEGATIVE	 (umm) But it was, it was (stutter) bad
NEUTRAL	Hello again
POSITIVE	 This is the Derek, this time with another DVD review and this one is one of (uhh) I mean come on if you were ever a teenage boy or (uhh) in the eighties or nineties or even nowadays, every party has a little (stutter) bit of a nerd, you will love Rush, the rock band Rush

POSITIVE	 (uhh) spanning thirty years of their career of such a phenomenal band (uhh) that, that (stutter) really is more influential to rock (uhh) and than than (stutter) so many other bands out there, I mean there are still going today
POSITIVE	 (umm) The second disk has a bunch of interviews with them, it has a vault of other, you know, music videos and some more live performances
POSITIVE	 But one of the special things for this whole box set is really when you open it up, it has such a beautiful presentation to any fan that shows you (uhh) a retrospective of the the years, has a (uhh) a live CD over here so you can listen to the live concert in your car, has the two disks, it also has (umm) some (uhh) autographed (uhh) guitar picks

POSITIVE	 It's a great (uhh) box set, amazingly good sound, (uhh) lots of easter eggs on here, they even say on the back good luck finding them, but I can't recommend it better if you are a fan to listen to one of their greater concerts that they have put on a long time in adobe five point one audio
POSITIVE	 I definitely pick it up if you are a fan, if you just are a kid today and want to know what a great rock band out there is still living and, and working and breathing sounds like you know, pick it up and check it out
NEUTRAL	I'm doing a review for the movie Ghost Rider starring Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes
NEGATIVE	 (umm) This was probably the worst Marvel movie I have ever seen
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) But other than that there weren't many positives in this movie
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It was just, I was just waiting for this movie to be over it was so boring
NEGATIVE	 (umm) Eva Mendes can't really act well, but she is extremely easy on the eyes
NEUTRAL	 So if you need an excuse to see that movie (uhh) fellas, that's one
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It's even better than Dare (stutter), or even worse than Daredevil I mean
NEGATIVE	 I actually liked Daredevil a little bit, but this was just awful
NEGATIVE	 (umm) It stars Cage as the Ghost Rider, a supernatural (uhh) bounty hunter of the devil, who has to go and chase another bad guy called Black Heart (umm) before he can collect souls and become super powerful
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) The story was really boring
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) It didn't go anywhere for a long time

NEUTRAL	 (uhh) Watching (umm) Nicolas Cage transform into the Ghost Rider and back, seeing his flesh peel away, things like that
POSITIVE	 It was cool to see that
NEUTRAL	This is a review of the dvd movie Gosford Park
NEUTRAL	 (umm) It came out in two thousand one on USA Films, also on Universal
NEUTRAL	 (umm) Even like the cover like makes you think it's gonna be like some xxx nation like wrong turn, I don't know some sort of horror movie or something
NEGATIVE	 And this really wasn't
NEGATIVE	 I wasn't too impressed I hardly watched any of it and (umm) I was kind of let down, (umm) I thought the original previews in two thousand really led me astray and then I rewatched (umm) one on the internet (umm) today right, (uhh) right as I was watching it and it {laugh} seemed a lot different so I don't know maybe there's another Gosford Park out there but this Gosford Park is sure not (umm) a horror movie, so (uhh) don't rent it
NEUTRAL	 If you're looking for a horror movie
NEUTRAL	 (umm) {laugh} I'm not gonna lie I saw the previews for this movie in two thousand one when it came out
NEGATIVE	 For some reason I had thought that this was going to be like (uhh) like a horror movie and people were going to be like getting killed in this house and it was going to be really sweet
POSITIVE	 And I always like it had been a movie in the back of my head that I'd been wanting to rent or buy for a long time
NEUTRAL	 And I rent movies online and I put, {laugh} put it in my list and sure enough I get it and it is nothing like that
NEUTRAL	 It's like an old stool like (umm) you know like a murder theme mystery in someone's house
NEUTRAL	 (umm) with like British accent people, English accents
NEGATIVE	 And (umm) I don't know, I, it definitely seemed more like a B film to me
NEGATIVE	 I wasn't too impressed
POSITIVE	Is it still a buyer�s market today in Washington DC? As experts in the Washington DC real estate market, we get asked this question a lot, and the answer isn�t as simple as yes or no
NEUTRAL	 Lots of sellers are trying out speculative prices just to see if anyone bites, but most investors are walking away from deals that don�t pencil out
NEUTRAL	 Thirdly, financing is still a major obstacle for buyers
NEUTRAL	 Banks are still being strict, requiring money down and even changing their terms at the last minute
NEUTRAL	 It�s not uncommon for approved buyers to get their loans denied right before their closing, although it�s getting better than it was just a couple of years ago as credit standards have begun loosening somewhat again
NEUTRAL	 In general, the markets remain strong
POSITIVE	 If you are trying to decide whether or not to sell your house, we can help you
POSITIVE	 There�s a lot of shakeup in the US economy still taking place with the markets moving fast and in lots of directions at once, but we�re investing in the Washington DC area because we believe in the community and the people here
NEUTRAL	 If you need to sell a property in or near Washington DC, we can help
POSITIVE	 I�m Brad Chandler from Express Homebuyers and I would like to talk with you about the real estate market in Washington DC
NEUTRAL	 The market really depends on the property type and location because while single-family homes, in great locations that are priced well, have been flying off the shelves, there are other areas that are a bit slower
POSITIVE	 To better explain - I would like to talk about some different factors that play a role in the market
NEUTRAL	 First of all, buyers are often looking for the same thing , which is good neighborhoods, access to transportation and shopping, good schools, and being close to work, to name a few
NEUTRAL	 Properties that deliver all these conditions are definitely a hot commodity and sellers with a highly desirable property are in control of the market
POSITIVE	 Secondly, investment properties are in demand
POSITIVE	 The massive amounts of foreign cash flooding into the US to invest in real estate has impacted the Washington DC area in unique ways
POSITIVE	 Overall, those people in a position to pay cash for properties have been picking up the good deals in the marketplace
NEUTRAL	Some people number all the boxes
NEUTRAL	To work out who gets more votes, we can not just look at the ballot papers of the surplus votes
NEGATIVE	They will not fairly represent all the second choices
POSITIVE	The order you number candidates is important and will impact on which candidates are elected
NEUTRAL	Candidates win by reaching a quota — a certain number of votes
NEUTRAL	The quota is based on the overall number of votes and is different for each region
NEUTRAL	In the following examples, we show you how proportional representation works when 3 candidates are elected
NEUTRAL	For real Legislative Council elections, 5 members are elected
NEUTRAL	Candidate 4 has more votes than the quota and is elected

NEGATIVE	Does he mean potentially that the government is now going to create its own lending facility to compete directly with the commercial banks?
NEUTRAL	If so, is that a way to try to force more competition in the banking system, to try to get those banks to start lending?
POSITIVE	I think it's going to be very interesting to watch how the details unfold on what exactly he means by this new lending fund.
NEUTRAL	Another thing that Obama addressed in his discussion and has talked about before is the mortgage bailout.
NEUTRAL	He specifically said again and again and again that his policies are going to be aimed to make sure that speculators don't benefit nor our people who have bought homes that they could not afford, they also are not going to benefit from the bailout.
NEUTRAL	Who is going to make that decision on who exactly was a speculator or who is going to make the decision on who bought a home that they could not afford.
NEUTRAL	Does this mean that we are going to potentially change our bankruptcy laws?
NEGATIVE	The Bush administration had put forward a plan that was very, very murky, didn't have a correct alignment of incentives and so on.

POSITIVE	Until next time, I'm Mike Brandl from the University of Texas at Austin.
NEUTRAL	One of the things that we see the press constantly talking about is this issue of potential nationalization of the banks.
NEUTRAL	But if you look at President Obama's speech last night, he made it clear that that's really not the path he intends on taking.
NEUTRAL	The second issue that Obama brings up and I think one that needs to be looked at very, very carefully is he talks about creating a new lending fund that is going to ensure that more money will make its way to households to buy automobiles, to fund college education and also to entrepreneurs.

POSITIVE	 (umm) It's a classic
NEUTRAL	This is a review for the movie Pathfinder
NEUTRAL	 (uhh) What Pathfinder's about is it's about before America was discovered by (stutter) Christopher Columbus it was discovered by vikings
NEGATIVE	 (uhh) I wanted the fricking bad guy to die the entire movie, I wanted the good guy to die, I wanted everybody to just die so it would be over and I wouldn't have to listen to it anymore or watch it
NEGATIVE	 I was falling asleep half the way and it was ridiculous because (uhh) ticket prices are so expensive so I don't recommend you see this
NEGATIVE	 If you really, really want to see it rent it with like Netflix or something so you don't have to pay for it
NEGATIVE	 It's terrible, I don't recommend it

NEUTRAL	 It's in theaters
NEUTRAL	 And it tells the story of some vikings that came to (uhh) America around the Canadian area
NEGATIVE	 And for some reason they left, and they left behind one of their kids and the kid got picked up by Indians and he was raised by Indians
NEUTRAL	 Then like twenty years later the vikings come back to to (stutter) take over the land and the kid has, is now a grown up and he's part of the Indian culture and he's going to stop the vikings from taking over the Americas and ruling them and killing them all cause they're very savage people

POSITIVE	On patient financing here in the office; of course one of the things we try our best to do is get good accurate information on their insurance
POSITIVE	 If they have dental insurance, we want to get as accurate information as we can so we can estimate things well for them
POSITIVE	 The primary financing option we use is something called Care Credit, it gives some great interest free options so it’s a great way to break down some bigger expenses that way
POSITIVE	 We’re always looking for new things; and we’ve had some other programs like Care Credit, we still use some of them but Care Credit seems to be the one that we get the best approval rating, approval from for patients
POSITIVE	 We’re always looking for new things that we can do to help patients in that area
POSITIVE	 We’re actually looking at an in-office discount plan of some kind especially for our patients without insurance
POSITIVE	 That topic has come up before so that’s something we’re looking at and maybe something we can offer here in the near future
POSITIVE	 Just one more option for folks to kind of get a little bit of a savings, a little bit of a break on things and plus, it benefits us because folks keep coming to see us that way too
POSITIVE	 The big thing with financial things in the office is we like patients to know what to expect
NEGATIVE	 There’s nothing like coming in and thinking you’ve got a hundred dollar thing you’re having done and walk out front and the ladies tell you it’s five hundred dollars
NEGATIVE	 Surprises like that are not good
NEUTRAL	 One thing we are constantly talking about with that end of the practice is we don’t want patients to have surprises
POSITIVE	 We want them to know what to expect, try to give them as good an estimate as we can with their insurance
NEUTRAL	 That can be interesting at times dealing with their insurance companies because they’re sometimes a moving target
POSITIVE	 But we do file folk’s insurance, we estimate what their copay should be and have them pay that at the time of service, but then we have the insurance reimburse us
POSITIVE	 It’s interesting when it comes to insurance, there are all the time, CE courses, continuing education courses out there of people giving their recommendations
NEUTRAL	 A big thing that was going around a few years ago was, have the patients pay it all up front and let the insurance reimburse them
NEUTRAL	 Well, that’s not real customer service related and there are folks who tried that and found out real quickly that didn’t work so well
NEUTRAL	 So we file the insurance, do the paperwork, and when it comes to what the patient’s portion is, whether they have insurance or not, I mean depending on what they need, sometimes I can it can be more than what you want to write a check for out of your checking account this week
NEUTRAL	Hey there Expo TV goers

NEGATIVE	 So, don't see it
POSITIVE	The office that I worked in was above the factory and it was my job to be part of the production planning team and we told the factory what to make to meet customer demand.
POSITIVE	By the start... At the start of the year, I wouldn't have been able to do that and that's like a massive tick.
NEUTRAL	They've ...at first they'd asked me if I would consider not coming back to Uni and to stay with them but I've obviously made the decision to get my degree and it's in the back of my mind that I could go back there but I'm gonna see what's out there for the minute as well.
POSITIVE	I've come back after my placement so much more motivated because I know what's out there and what I need to do to get there.
POSITIVE	Because you're in such a routine on your placement year, now that I've come back to Uni, I am applying that work ethic here, so I'm really glad that I did my placement year.
POSITIVE	To begin with, it was just getting used to learning how the factory actually runs and what goes into just like the simple task of making bottled drinks.
POSITIVE	What I got from this role was mainly confidence, like the change throughout the year, like when you started, one of the main roles is to go to a meeting every morning where you're talking to the leaders of each Department.

NEUTRAL	PT's don't want to embarrass their patients or appear insensitive.
NEGATIVE	It is important to remember that as the health professional it's up to you to maintain the professional boundaries, even when the behaviour is instigated by the patient.
NEUTRAL	The first thing you need to do is identify what is wrong with the behaviour with the patient.
NEUTRAL	Secondly, you need to tell the patient what it is that you expect from them and any policies you have in your clinic about appropriate behaviour.
NEGATIVE	For example, the consequence may be that if they continue with the inappropriate comments you'll have to discontinue their treatment.
POSITIVE	So again that's three things, you need to identify the behaviour, you need to tell them what you expect, and then you also need to describe what the consequences will be if the behaviour doesn't change.

NEUTRAL	And travel, somebody mentioned it earlier, for many people is incremental.
NEGATIVE	I mean we were seeing and hearing from customers that, “Hey, I normally go see my clients twice a month, well now I’m only allowed to go see them once a month.” Well, for that consumer, we just lost half their travel budget.

POSITIVE	" And then the next colleague says, "No, I think we should be doing this
NEUTRAL	" Those are signs of an organization that is not customer centric because their internal people, their employees, are speaking on behalf of the customer
POSITIVE	 A customer-centric organization speaks like this: Our customers are telling us we need to do more of this or less of that
POSITIVE	 Let's build the right strategies or programs to increase customer loyalty, and let's take what our customers are saying and include their feedback
POSITIVE	 That is how a customer-centric organization operates
POSITIVE	 If you don't believe in the customer-centric model, let's take a look at Amazon
POSITIVE	 Amazon is a company that is a hundred-billion-dollar market capitalization

POSITIVE	And there have been lots of people that have been working on providing those kinds of opportunities in our Promise Neighborhood area for many years.
POSITIVE	And just like it took some time for some of the things we don't want to see happen in the Promise Neighborhood area, it's going to take some time for the good things we want to see happen getin place.
POSITIVE	I think one of the things that New Futures is very well positioned to do is to get good input and involvement from the community into the Promise Neighborhood initiative.
NEUTRAL	We have some strong institutional partners and we also want to make sure that we involve grassroots community based organizations and individuals, parents, residents of the community, and young people that are growing up in the community in the decision making processes and the designing key elements of our pipeline of opportunitites.

NEUTRAL	sector, and a more growth-promoting sector
NEUTRAL	In the case of Mozambique, it's a country that's rich in mineral resources
NEUTRAL	They have received, been blessed by a substantial amount of investment in the mineral sector
NEGATIVE	But so are other countries that are struggling to overcome conflict
POSITIVE	The Congo receives huge amounts of investments in the mineral sector
NEGATIVE	But because it's still lacking the institutional basis, the institutional framework for managing the natural resources, you do not see the benefits in terms of development
POSITIVE	PERIES: Leonce, that's a very important point
NEUTRAL	Obviously both Mozambique and Rwanda's success is prefaced by a leadership that actually understands some of these issues and problems, and therefore want--there's a great desire to address them
NEUTRAL	As a listener you want to try and take on the whole understanding of everything that the speaker is trying to say before you respond.

POSITIVE	" And when I heard that a lot of things started to make sense
NEGATIVE	It was a program called Oasis
POSITIVE	It was a summer recreation program
POSITIVE	The young people did basketball, games, water fights
POSITIVE	It was cool, it was important, but I didn't think it was a huge impact

POSITIVE	Go to the citizentube YouTube channel and create a Google Moderator account there, and sumbit your answer to the question: What is the number one way that the U.S.
NEUTRAL	And then vote on the questions submitted by other people and we will submit the top three, or four, or five voted up questions from you to the Congress to help determine the way forward on YouTube.
NEUTRAL	Well, it certainly isn't evidence FOR your claim
NEUTRAL	At best, it means we should withhold judgement
NEGATIVE	But not only that, sometimes absence of evidence IS evidence of absence if we look where the evidence should be and it isn't there
NEUTRAL	It also tries to avoid the unlikelihood of their premise, or at least, the superior likelihood of alternatives
POSITIVE	Let's say it's 1947 and you're in the town of Roswell, New Mexico
NEUTRAL	You see something fall from the sky
NEUTRAL	You run to check it out

NEUTRAL	hello class, I'm James and I don't know about you but the subtitle thing took me forever to figure out, just had to say that.
POSITIVE	Being that we are in week 3 and not to much to reflect on in the textbook I went with rituals of communication.
POSITIVE	I believe that life is full of algorithms, patterns and history constantly repeating itself before last week I had never really applied that to communication and that was pretty enlightening.
NEGATIVE	I have applied it to behaviors tho, the best example I could give you is Adam in the garden because more often than not when you catch someone doing wrong the first thing they try to do is hide, the second thing is too use the proverbial fig leaf and try to cover it up and when all else fails they blame someone else, I think it's pretty scary how ritualistic we all really are.
POSITIVE	To me, the exciting part is figuring out this whole new world of social media, but not just social media in, I think, its current form of Twitter and Facebook and blogging, but adding the kind of GPS technology to that.
NEUTRAL	So what that allows me to do is, right now if I have a Facebook conversation, you could be in Shanghai, China, you could be in Detroit, Michigan, you could be in Texas.
POSITIVE	So if I’m talking to my father, he’s probably not so excited about Gowalla and Four Square, but he is using technology that I never thought he would use, which is his Facebook, ‘cause he loves to see his grandchildren on Facebook.
POSITIVE	I mean just the fact that Facebook is what, the fourth or fifth largest-- the population of Facebook is bigger than four or five other-- or the rest of the-- other than four or five countries than the rest of the world.
POSITIVE	I think that technology that allows us to have that personal interaction and it’s GPS, it’s specific to the day and the location, I think is really exciting and I think that’s where I see us going in the coming months.
NEUTRAL	And so, let's, you know
NEUTRAL	I didn't get a specific question, but let's look at just like one example of something that a person who is an Atheist might have an issue with
NEUTRAL	And so, you know, a lot of Atheists don't believe that there's any kind of life after death because there's nothing, there is just what we have

NEUTRAL	I joined this program because I used to be a university student,  but I gave up my studies because I got married; hence, this program allowed me to get back in the technology field  and improve myself  and open new horizons for me  despite the fact that I am married and have kids.
NEUTRAL	I would like to thank Abadieh scouts center, MEPI, Microsoft and IIE.

POSITIVE	ANDY MURRAY: If you look at the innovation advertising, I really like what Levi's is doing.
POSITIVE	They're doing some really fun stuff with pop-up stores, and how they're integrating the brand into workshops.
NEUTRAL	I have a confession to make
NEUTRAL	I'm a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead
NEUTRAL	If we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again, we must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership
NEUTRAL	But recently, I've discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation
NEUTRAL	I use the methods of anthropology to understand the questions in which I'm interested
POSITIVE	So along with three co-conspirators, I spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation
POSITIVE	We studied 16 men and women, located in seven countries across the globe, working in 12 different industries
NEUTRAL	In total, we spent hundreds of hours on the ground, on-site, watching these leaders in action

NEUTRAL	It's almost like he's the ventriloquist and the dummy at the same time
NEGATIVE	Like, what-what is going on here
NEUTRAL	That's how I speak to people
NEUTRAL	Uh, now, you might be thinking, "Trevor, I recognize the name Mnuchin, but not from tax news
NEUTRAL	" Well, maybe it's because last month he tried to get you to pay for his honeymoon
NEUTRAL	REPORTER: <i>Newly married this past summer,</i> <i> multimillionaire Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin</i> <i> formally requested that he and his new wife Louise</i> <i> be allowed to travel in style in a government jet</i> <i> on their honeymoon to Europe
POSITIVE	There was a study done that shows 80 percent of your pitching velocity comes from hip to shoulder separation
NEUTRAL	But before we get into that let's talk about the arm path and hand separation ok
POSITIVE	Your hands want to separate down low here and you want to break them at an angle 45 degrees or more
POSITIVE	Because if I do that, that puts me into a good spot when I get into my thoracic extension or scap load

NEUTRAL	One of the things that we're getting asked a lot now is what is programmatic advertising?
POSITIVE	We're doing a lot of them and are pretty excited about it, so I'm happy to explain it to you.
NEUTRAL	One is that it's CPM-based, so you're paying for every impression every time your ad shows-- not a cost-per-click based system like the Google Display Network.
NEUTRAL	The two main reasons people move from a living will which is a very simple document that just passes asset A to person A.
NEUTRAL	You're also talking about when your children would be able to inherit assets and that may be a tricky proposition.
POSITIVE	If you have children, the main concern with a living trust is that you're going to want to take a look at who's going to be the guardian for the children and also how the assets are going to be disbursed over time.
NEUTRAL	I'm a certified financial with Asti Financial Management and you can learn more about my company and my services at www.astifinancial.com.
NEGATIVE	This is Ron Paul with your weekly update for Faced with continuing economic decline and an impending election, the administration, predictably, is entertaining the idea of another stimulus package.
NEUTRAL	To explain why the last one didn't work, adherents to the Keynesian economic philosophy are claiming that they actually did work – it just looks like they didn't because we don't realize how much worse off we would be right now without trillions of dollars of public spending.
NEGATIVE	Worse, will the government come up with fines or additional costs if businesses have to lay people off in the future?
NEUTRAL	Right now, the safest thing for businesses to do is nothing.
NEGATIVE	Until we regain respect for the rule of law and remove some of this uncertainty, I'm afraid none of these temporary promises, made right before an election, will do much towards any economic improvement.
NEGATIVE	The other glaring problem with this proposed stimulus package is that it couples tax cuts with spending increases, which makes no sense when we are already heavily indebted to foreign countries.
NEGATIVE	The private sector simply cannot bear the burden of our engorged public sector.
NEGATIVE	In fact, one reason earlier stimulus programs did not result in any private sector growth is because large amounts went to the public sector.
NEGATIVE	Indeed, the spending that the administration is now proposing arguably constitutes a bailout of the public sector and various union allies of the administration.
NEGATIVE	The temptation is to do something, anything, proactive to attempt to stimulate the economy, but history has shown us that governments cannot spend their way into prosperity.
NEGATIVE	The last administration bought into Keynesianism just as much as this one does, unfortunately.
NEUTRAL	The best thing government could do is get back to its Constitutional limitations and let the economy stabilize, heal and recover without the crushing burden of government holding it back.
NEUTRAL	A new update is placed on this number, 888-322-1414 every on my website www.house.gov/paul under the heading "Texas Straight Talk". Thanks for calling.
NEGATIVE	Until we have leaders who understand that debt is not the way to prosperity, there will be no stopping runaway government spending.
NEGATIVE	While it is nice to hear about business tax breaks, the positive results of these tax cuts will be dwarfed by its negative effects.
NEGATIVE	Second of all, businesses are reluctant to hire and invest, not because they are looking for temporary credits, but because of future uncertainty; they simply don't know what the government is going to do next and how future government policies will affect decisions they make now.
NEUTRAL	What new costs and regulations will be placed on them with healthcare reform and financial services reform?
NEGATIVE	Will Congress convene a lame-duck session this winter to pass cap-and-trade and other destructive legislation?
NEGATIVE	What will the cost of compliance be for hiring new employees, and will that force them to simply lay off anyone they hire now?

NEUTRAL	Some children don't learn to talk until they're a great deal older than others, and some learn to talk very rapidly.

POSITIVE	until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out, and she squealed with delight
POSITIVE	So: three toddlers with identical plastic toys, but with very different reactions to failure
NEUTRAL	The first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button
POSITIVE	The only thing that prevented them from succeeding was that their mind tricked them into believing they could not
NEGATIVE	Now, adults get tricked this way as well, all the time
POSITIVE	In fact, we all have a default set of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks
NEUTRAL	Are you aware of how your mind reacts to failure
NEGATIVE	The problem is is that Alex doesn't like magic
NEGATIVE	So she doesn't want it and she wants to do whatever she can to get rid of it
NEUTRAL	But instead of doing that, she decides to cast a spell that she thinks will remove her of her powers
NEGATIVE	But instead what it does is it takes her family and it causes her family to disappear
POSITIVE	That crosses a completely different line so you have to stay calm, stay professional most times just by doing that and using the proper professional tone you can defuse a situation and you will calm a customer down.
NEGATIVE	The customer comes at you with a very upset loud tone; don't match the customers tone.
NEGATIVE	The worst thing that I can do is to become angry right along with them.
POSITIVE	something they take very seriously and that really set her apart from the rest of the group
POSITIVE	What you really want to do is keep your answers about them and how well the two of you can work together
POSITIVE	Make sure you do research on the company before you go in for the interview
POSITIVE	Take a look around at their website and see if they won any awards maybe for how they treat their employees or how they treat their customers
POSITIVE	I would love to join the team
POSITIVE	So the three things to answer this question really well are: First, talk about how much you admire the company
POSITIVE	Second, talk about what a great fit you would be in this position
POSITIVE	And third, show that you've done research on the company itself

POSITIVE	Since its inception in 2001, the Gilman program has included grantees with disabilities

NEUTRAL	In 2006, Open Doors, funded by ECA, begins collecting data on US students with disabilities who study abroad
POSITIVE	In 2006, the first English Access Microscholarship program to include students with disabilities takes place in Libya
NEUTRAL	What you're going to want to do first of course is you have lots of retail experience you're going to want to put your most recent and most impressive experience first.
POSITIVE	And also detail in your cover letter how your expertise and your level of expertise will help the company grow and prosper.
NEUTRAL	So not only make your resume immaculate but also put in your cover letter just how important all of your experience is.
NEUTRAL	So not only list your position in the store, but also everything that you did with the store.
POSITIVE	Because in a retail job, it's sort of like you have these skills that you can just keep building on that are going to pretty much work pretty well for lots of different retail jobs.
NEUTRAL	Say a couple of the key trends that we’re seeing in marketing for education space has been pretty much what a lot of people are trying to do, which is experimentation and experimentation and mediums that are not necessarily proven.
NEUTRAL	And so for example if we looked at social media, things like Twitter, you know, how do we measure a return on our investment if it’s not necessarily directly related to lead generation activities, which is very common for the education space on line.
NEUTRAL	Or do you try to segment to that medium and say, okay, we’ll capture them when they’re in this frame of mind doing this particular activity?
NEUTRAL	And so not only are they watching TV, but they’re also on line.
NEUTRAL	They’re engaging in text or chats, so there’s three or four things simultaneously going on with this generation.
POSITIVE	Rental income if taking into account, can add to your serviceability of that property significantly.
POSITIVE	If you're struggling with a borrowing capacity then maybe going with the lender who takes all that rental income into account might mean that you can borrow more money .I do suggest that you always go and speak to your mortgage broker about this because he will have access to all the lenders, they know all the criteria and they can help you out.
POSITIVE	So look out for that, it is coming down the pipeline very shortly.
POSITIVE	If you want more videos, articles and podcasts just like this one, this is a shortest one I've done a long time, head over to PositiveCashflowsAustarlia.com.au or if you are on your mobile phone just type in pci.im.
NEUTRAL	You're renting a property for four hundred or five hundred dollars per week then you're looking at about twenty-five thousand dollars per year almost that you are adding in serviceability if the lender will take that into account.
NEUTRAL	The answer is yes, some lenders will take rental income into account.
POSITIVE	I'm sure there are some lenders out there who won�t touch it and who won't take it into account but in most circumstances lenders will take a portion of rental income into account.
NEUTRAL	There's one lender at the moment which I think is just Bankwest who don't take rental income into account, they take rental yield into account.
POSITIVE	So that will just give you an average rental yield of maybe 3 or 4 %, something pretty low and they'll just say �we don't care what the property is renting for we're going to say it's going to for the 3 % yield and here is what will allocate to you.
NEGATIVE	And it was talking about the violence and how there was great concern that there were mass atrocities and potential genocide.
NEGATIVE	How can we, in the United States, help stop the world's worst humanitarian crisis, thousands of miles away?
POSITIVE	One of the inspirations for this was reading about how the African Union was sorely underfunded.
NEUTRAL	Here, people are willing to put their lives on the line but they just need boots, or they need maps, or walkie-talkies, or tents.

POSITIVE	 It didn't stop me, and I didn't use it as a crutch, but they definitely had some understanding and would be patient with me in some situations when I really, really needed it

NEUTRAL	And I can tell you from my prospective, that the pros and cons are also the goods and bads if you will, or also the bads and goods.
NEUTRAL	Again, I think for me staying away from my family for any too extended period of time does start to hurt emotionally, but I think that the pros way out weigh the cons, or I don't think anybody would do it.
NEUTRAL	I do miss my family once in a while, but I love going out on the road and doing it.
NEUTRAL	Which means I fly on Wednesday, teach on Thursday, come back on Friday.
POSITIVE	And I love that part, I love my time in the hotel room alone.
POSITIVE	I hope you learned something about raising the chi in your home, and I thank you very much.
NEUTRAL	The way that we measure the effectiveness of our advertising is to understand what the pulse of the consumer is at all times.

William Snyder will co-lead the Deloitte CRG practice with incumbent practice leader, Sheila Smith.
NEGATIVE	So then you have people that follow them that think well my leaders want peace, they say they want peace, I want peace so if they think it's okay to build more settlements, that will bring peace, they're going to follow those people but we're not going to get peace.
NEGATIVE	And they're not paying off that experience, and it's not useful for me.
NEUTRAL	And the reason is because-- and this ultimately getting to the answer to your question is-- we put everything in that box.
POSITIVE	And when it comes to health, it's incredibly important, because I've either just been diagnosed with something, a family member's been diagnosed with something, or you know what?
POSITIVE	We try to do our job in the safest possible manner, and we are dedicated to flying because we love it, it's a passion of ours and because people enjoy going places faster.
POSITIVE	So it's fun, it's diverse, it requires good communication skills and we also enjoy just hanging around talking about flying.

POSITIVE	Then you could always go on and say but we have to do this or we have to do that but try to be understanding and empathetic.
POSITIVE	So try to listen and understand how they would feel and then respond with that empathy.
POSITIVE	Increasing women's entrepreneurship is just plain good economics.
POSITIVE	It represents 85% of global GDP, and the fact that they have focused on financial inclusion, on the challenges of SME's, is a testament to the fact that they recognize that this is the key to economic opportunity for all.
NEUTRAL	When we talk about financial inclusion in small and medium enterprises, those are policies that are gender neutral, but we know that because of the barriers that women face, focusing on financial inclusion in small and medium enterprises will have a disproportionately positive impact on women and girls.
NEUTRAL	So your car just died and you need credit, and it doesn't look too good.
NEGATIVE	Certain things you're going to want to do is avoid salts and high sodium products as salt helps retain fluids and it won't let you get away from them as quickly.
POSITIVE	Also exercise helps but remember to drink fluids when you're exercising to help sweat out that excess fluid.
NEUTRAL	Also if you find bloating is just not relieved with any of these, definitely consult a physician and see if maybe there's other alternatives that you can take to help you with bloating.
POSITIVE	You can also avoid loans altogether by applying for scholarship and grants and possibly, having a job and saving money.
NEUTRAL	If it is the time in the nation where interest rates are low, you're going to be able to find lower interest rates.
POSITIVE	 I attend Walther Lutheran High School and I am interested in Western Illinois because of its strong Broadcasting program that they have, and how close it is to home.
POSITIVE	I'm here to announce the winner of Round 1 of the #HartHouseWinterBlast sweepstakes which we've been doing throughout the week.

NEUTRAL	As you rely on that equipment for your safety and your comfort as that is your workplace and your home out on the road.

POSITIVE	Again, we know that equipment is very important to you and having that safe, reliable equipment is a key to your success delivering to our customers safely and timely and for you to earn the miles and the pay that you deserve.
NEGATIVE	Charlie Carr, Boston, Massachusetts It was an incredibly huge shock because my disability was traumatic.
NEGATIVE	And if you don't follow those prescribed rules, you are quote non-compliant.
NEGATIVE	So life for me in institutions was very difficult because I wanted to do things that weren't considered normal in that environment.
NEGATIVE	So for me, it was hard to realize that I could get out of bed when I wanted to, I couldn't go to bed when I wanted to, I couldn't eat when I wanted to, I couldn't eat what I wanted to.
NEGATIVE	So for me there was a huge denial factor going on that for someone who might have a congenital disability might not be as much of an issue.
NEGATIVE	I was devastated and so when I put into an institution and I went into this segregated high school I was very angry because I couldn't be with my peers at the local high school.
NEGATIVE	But when I went there and I saw all these people in wheelchairs, I just remember thinking, "This isn't me." But it was me.
NEGATIVE	And so I was very freaked out by what I saw and it hit me very hard, the realization that, "You are these people." What really hurt me, then, was finding out what I lost.

NEUTRAL	We all know that about 50 percent of all consumers are spending a lot of time on social media and the younger generations are spending an inordinate amount of time on these sites.
POSITIVE	Because versus television, online video provides better measurability, better targetability, and better share ability.
NEUTRAL	Five days later I was back down again to screen test It was that strange.
POSITIVE	So anyway, they came to Seattle, this one woman came to Seattle I met her, read for her, she was impressed enough to recommend me to David.

NEGATIVE	JON TESTER: Look, I don't think it's going the move the ball
NEGATIVE	I think there is another agenda here
NEGATIVE	And if that's the direction we're headed, then that's not the direction I want to go
NEUTRAL	I think that that skinny bill, that bait-and-switch bill, whatever you want to call it, Trojan horse repeal bill, that bill is not where we will end up at
NEGATIVE	And I don't think you get the conservatives with that bill
NEGATIVE	And I don't think you get the moderates either
NEUTRAL	That's all very convoluted, in the weeds, but that's where we're headed
NEUTRAL	Hi, I'm Carmen Lynne with Expert Village and we've been talking about handwriting analysis and I hope you have realized how fascinating this whole subject is.
NEUTRAL	It's obviously a huge subject and there's a lot more to learn about it, but I've probably given you just a little overview of all the different aspects.
NEGATIVE	The leading international powers have bet our collective future on a deal with the foremost sponsor of international terrorism.
NEUTRAL	Iran's Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, said on March 21 that the deal does not limit Iran's aggression in any way.
NEGATIVE	He said: 'Negotiations with the United States are on the nuclear issue and on nothing else.' And three days ago he made that clear again.
NEGATIVE	In addition to filling Iran's terror war chest, this deal repeats the mistakes made with North Korea.
NEUTRAL	There too we were assured that inspections and verifications would prevent a rogue regime from developing nuclear weapons.
NEGATIVE	Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran and Israel is not bound by this deal with Iran because Iran continues to seek our destruction.
NEGATIVE	They've gambled that in ten years' time, Iran's terrorist regime will change while removing any incentive for it to do so.
NEGATIVE	In fact, the deal gives Iran every incentive not to change.
NEGATIVE	In the coming decade, the deal will reward Iran, the terrorist regime in Tehran, with hundreds of billions of dollars.
NEGATIVE	Amazingly, this bad deal does not require Iran to cease its aggressive behavior in any way.
NEUTRAL	And just last Friday, that aggression was on display for all to see.
NEGATIVE	While the negotiators were closing the deal in Vienna, Iran's supposedly moderate President chose to go to a rally in Tehran and at this rally, a frenzied mob burned American and Israeli flags and chanted 'Death to America, Death to Israel!' Now, this didn't happen four years ago.
NEUTRAL	monsters have a perpetual effect all the time
NEUTRAL	This effect is: While the monster is in play, wizards may not improve their grade
NEUTRAL	That's not a terrible thing to happen at the beginning of the game, whereas Parakeet of Paralysis, if that gets activated, discard any two cards
NEUTRAL	And that only happens to the active wizard, not to all the players in the game
POSITIVE	So these monsters are now the monsters you start out with roaming the halls of Wizard School
NEUTRAL	Your Parakeet of Paralysis and your School Spirit
NEUTRAL	Step 4 is your main step where you can customize the difficulty of the game and that is with graduation cards
POSITIVE	You have freshmen level difficulty cards, you have sophomore level difficulty cards, you have junior level difficulty cards, and you have your senior year cards
POSITIVE	The senior year cards are very, very difficult
POSITIVE	Your freshmen year cards actually make the game a little bit easier
POSITIVE	A useful non-digital source of information is witnesses-- finding people who have seen something going on.
NEUTRAL	Sometimes what we think we see is not actually what occurred.
NEUTRAL	So although the information they're giving you they may feel is absolutely 100% accurate, you should always find ways to get a second party to verify what they're doing.
NEUTRAL	Or in some way try to figure out what they're saying, and try to put it in context of what actually occurred.
NEUTRAL	Maybe they saw someone walk in the front door that they didn't recognize.
NEUTRAL	So document, talk to them, call them, write down what they've seen, gather information about what they happen to have identified that day.
POSITIVE	So you want to get something that's very top of mind, very fresh in their memory.
NEUTRAL	I am not an accountant nor am I a lawyer, so this should not be construed as legal advice or tax accounting advice.
NEUTRAL	So talk to your lawyer, talk to your accountant about this.
POSITIVE	But a Sole Proprietorship is a great way to start your business.
POSITIVE	I started my business and ran it for over twenty years as a Sole Proprietorship.
NEUTRAL	By being an S-Corp it actually costs you less in taxes, it allows you to write things off differently, and here's a big deal from someone who has been audited by the IRS, the probability of you being audited by the IRS, when you're an S-Corp, is a fraction of what it is when you're a Sole Proprietor.
NEUTRAL	Sole Proprietorship who write off in Schedule-C's often get audited and certainly at a much higher rate than an S-Corp.
POSITIVE	It's about creating something that from the beginning as you're creating it is built in a way to have multiple uses
NEUTRAL	For any different modality because I've build it right
POSITIVE	So, it's about creating it once and delivering it often
POSITIVE	So, we got to capture that information in a unique way
NEUTRAL	We call it in Thoughtpreneur Academy and Thought leadership, we call it an IP snapshot to bring that to life
NEUTRAL	A lot of controversy surrounding whether or not an individual who is taking the oath of Canadian citizenship should have the right to cover up their face, usually for religious purposes while taking the oath.
POSITIVE	So that's my take, you may not agree or you may agree, you can click like or unlike and feel free to visit us at www.visaplace.com.
NEGATIVE	Well, generally speaking, I think they should have that right, however there is a concern about identity.
NEUTRAL	If you cover your face completely, will the oath taker be able to reveal themselves to the authorities, now that is obviously a concern.
POSITIVE	I think that it is essential that anyone taking the oath of Canadian citizenship has to identify themselves to the authorities.
NEUTRAL	Now that's a question that could be addressed by the authorities procedurally, but if that can be overcome?
NEUTRAL	If the oath taker who is wearing a religious garb, for example an hijab, can properly identify themselves, then they should have the right to do.
NEUTRAL	We after all live in a free society, that gives people the right to religious freedom, freedom of expression, doesn't mean you have to endorse those views, but that is part of being in a free society.
NEUTRAL	In the first lesson, we'll discuss integers and integer operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
POSITIVE	- One of the top questions I consistently get asked is: how do I scale my engagement across social? See, managing large communities or listening all the time, it's time consuming, and we've developed so many time-saving apps and software to help us automate the process, but herein lies the distinction
POSITIVE	 Processes can be automated, but one-on-one conversations meant to relationship-build cannot
NEUTRAL	 For instance, when you're doing e-mail triage every morning, do you question whether a particular e-mail is from a real person or is it an e-mail blast that's been personalized to you? Are you suspicious of the ads that you see are even re-targeted? Or do you stop looking at your direct messages on Twitter because all you seem to receive are automated messages? Your audience is just as sick of being bombarded with automation as you are, and in this discussion of automation, let's also consider the human error factor
NEGATIVE	 Currently, there is no automated system that prevents humans from making mistakes or social errors online
POSITIVE	 And as companies, we've been used to having a little space between developing content and distributing it
POSITIVE	 But digital sharing, especially immediacy of social, has made many of us wish there were more filters in place to prevent human mistakes from coming in
NEUTRAL	 So, where should we draw the line? People want us to be more human online, but part of the discomfort many companies have with embracing social business is the possibility of embarrassment due to that human error
NEGATIVE	 See, some of the errors committed online by corporations have been more than just embarrassing
NEGATIVE	 They've been career-ending
POSITIVE	 However, companies are learning to demonstrate humanity rather than knee-jerk reactions to save face
POSITIVE	 That's a good thing
NEGATIVE	 In the corporate world, there's still a little too much emphasis on appearing perfect
POSITIVE	 The bottom line is that meaningful one-on-one conversations require human-to-human interaction and a personal touch
NEUTRAL	 People are surprisingly forgiving brands when they own up to mistakes, and unfortunately some haters out there love to point fingers and jump all over imperfections, but for the most part, people understand
POSITIVE	 So sometimes however, the tools we use to automate some of our content distribution and sharing processes can exacerbate a mistake
POSITIVE	 It's the blending of the two that's an art form, and it's always evolving
POSITIVE	 See, when you can automate in the right places, the human touch points within any campaign, product release, or general sharing system, you've hit the jackpot
POSITIVE	 And to achieve this, we use the rule of thirds to split between automation, sharing, and one-on-one interaction
POSITIVE	 This will make the difference for companies and for people
NEUTRAL	 I approach it this way for myself, and a word of caution, while great tools do help us automate the process, too much automation of engagement gets us in trouble
POSITIVE	 The more complex we get with our automation systems, the harder we have to work at humanizing what we do
POSITIVE	 See, unfortunately the science of automation has taught your target audience to distrust most marketing
POSITIVE	It IS a wonderful blessing if Jesus has spoken to you in the past, whether it be 5, 10 or since the Lord Jesus spoke to you?
POSITIVE	DAVID ROMAN: The answer is absolutely yes, no question about it.
POSITIVE	Hello again everyone, Beverly here once more with yet another video about binary option trading and how you can improve at it.
POSITIVE	Doing your research will ALWAYS pay off, even more so with stocks, if you're not a very tech savvy person, google or apple stock, great as they may be, will end up costing you money, similarly for BP stocks if you don't know the oil market and so on.
NEUTRAL	Lastly - Pay attention to market conditions, large stocks like Apple, BP or General motors can often act as market drivers, instead of reacting to it, so you can sometimes pay attention to what they do and follow the trend with similar, yet smaller, stocks.
NEUTRAL	So I'm living witness that Nixon came into office uh, thinking about uh, reestablishing relations with China.
NEGATIVE	I, uh... Don and I went into the Oval Office, just the three of us: the President, Don, and myself.
NEUTRAL	We don't have relations with China.' Two years later almost to the day, Kissinger went on TV saying Richard Nixon was going to China.
POSITIVE	 Thanks for tuning in
POSITIVE	 One of the advantages of going to your local ACDelco professional service center is that we offer timing belt service kits that could save you valuable time, money, and possibly prevent future engine failures
NEUTRAL	 Our kits include all the component parts associated with belt service work: new pulleys, springs, tensioners and perhaps even a new water pump
NEUTRAL	 Replacing these wear components when replacing the timing belt is essential to ensuring the new belt performs to its mileage requirements
POSITIVE	 Replacing these components when changing the timing belt saves money on labor in most cases, as your technician will have already removed them and other engine accessories to service the timing belt
NEUTRAL	 Our kits for GM vehicles match original specifications for the belt material and supporting hardware – and our kits for other non GM vehicles meet or exceed factory specs, too
NEUTRAL	 Some competitors’ kits don’t include any original-equipment components
POSITIVE	 That’s important enough for me to say it again: ACDelco timing belts are manufactured with materials and construction technology identical to the original timing belt in your vehicle
NEGATIVE	 An inferior timing belt may cost less initially, but may cost more down the road if fails prematurely
NEUTRAL	 Check your owner’s manual today for the recommended timing belt service – and by the way: some engines use a timing chain instead of a belt
NEUTRAL	 In that case, periodic replacement isn’t necessary and there won’t be a mileage recommendation for service
POSITIVE	 I’m Peter Robert from ACDelco and I’m here to discuss the timing belt and the importance of having it replaced as preventative maintenance
POSITIVE	 If you’re unsure about your vehicle, ask a representative from your ACDelco professional service center
POSITIVE	 For vehicles with a timing belt, the investment in preventative maintenance through an ACDelco professional service center program participant may save you more in the long run – and prevent the hassle of a broken belt occurring at the most inopportune time
POSITIVE	 Because it is not often replaced, timing belt service is easy to overlook when your car is otherwise running well
NEGATIVE	 Unfortunately, there are no warning signs or symptoms of a worn belt
NEUTRAL	 It may simply break and the engine will stop running – whether you’re in your driveway or on the freeway
NEUTRAL	 With some engine types, a broken timing belt could also cause severe internal engine damage that could require major engine repair or even a new engine
POSITIVE	 That’s why it’s very important to check your owner’s manual for the mandatory replacement recommendations starting as early as 40,000 miles, but may be as high as 100,000 miles
POSITIVE	 For all of you not able to do this service work yourselves, please go to acdelco
POSITIVE	com and click on ‘find a service center’ to locate the closest ACDelco professional service center program participant
POSITIVE	SECRETARY CLINTON: I’m sorry I couldn’t be there in person, but I am delighted to send best wishes to all of you as you come together to find ways to elevate the status of women.

POSITIVE	By sharing best practices and brainstorming new initiatives, you are unlocking the potential of women across South Asia – and creating a brighter future for all citizens of the region.
POSITIVE	I look forward to hearing about the ideas you come up with.
POSITIVE	Closing the gender gap is a powerful prescription for economic growth.
NEGATIVE	But all over the world, women still face enormous obstacles to starting new businesses or expanding existing ones.
NEUTRAL	One has to remember, however, that when Mark Ordan took over at Sunrise, with its shares trading below 50 cents and bankruptcy looming, a sale of the company was always on the table, as sort of an \'93exit\'94 strategy if he could accomplish what many thought was a near impossible task.
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately for Mark, he exercised some options at 92 cents per share last March for 225,000 shares and then sold them at half the $14.50 value.
POSITIVE	Oh well, no one is crying and he has plenty more low-priced options to exercise and sell at the full deal price.
NEGATIVE	Plus, I was getting absolutely inundated with emails and pings on social media
NEUTRAL	People wanted me to follow up or elaborate with them on things that I talked about in the book
NEUTRAL	You know, that just amplified on that
NEUTRAL	And it was overwhelming, I mean I couldn't do that and be on the road at the same time
NEUTRAL	Yeah initially I was really worried, wondering if we had enough content
POSITIVE	And Stu kept assuring me, he said, you got tons of content
NEUTRAL	You know, you've got books, you've got all this content you've done your site
NEUTRAL	But I kept thinking, oh my gosh, I'm going to have to come up with this original content every single week
NEUTRAL	But that wasn't the case
POSITIVE	What I found was that you can really repurpose the same content and it's extremely rare when somebody says, oh that's just that blog post you did a while back
NEUTRAL	Hi I’m Amy with your GEB America update
POSITIVE	 Listen May is just around the corner and that means we're gonna happen schedule changes that you're gonna like coming out for the network I encourage you to go to GEB America dot com click on the schedule link
POSITIVE	 It’s easy to read plus you’ll get more information about our programmers
POSITIVE	 Also don't forget to check out our Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube some fun giveaways
NEGATIVE	E related questions and set them in a technical way ok don't bring in things that are your own opinions you know make sure that you know M&amp
NEUTRAL	That's the international sign for I don't know what I'm doing, so you don't want to just stand there, wagging your hands.
NEUTRAL	Whatever it is, that is not necessarily what you want to do for your character.
POSITIVE	And that's one of those tools that became extremely helpful to me because it made it so easy for me to make an e-mail contact with my legislator you know just using the template that was there, personalizing a little bit.
NEUTRAL	You enter in a zip code and you're given all of the contact information for your legislators, both on a state and a national level.
POSITIVE	I think it's very rewarding I mean, you know, it's difficult to be kept in a box for me, and also, you know, as a speech-language pathologist, communication is extremely important.
NEUTRAL	And I think one thing that helped me to kind of realize the importance of advocacy and understand the issues that are going on not only locally, but at a national level was to subscribe to things like Action Alerts, so that you can see what's happening, you know especially in federal legislation.
POSITIVE	If you're meeting somebody, you may want to add "and this was my really great cook that I was talking to you about." Adding those compliments make people respected and feel really good about themselves.
NEGATIVE	It can be really awkward if somebody feels that you're telling it just because you feel envy about it.
POSITIVE	I'm Hazely Lopez from Hazely Academy of Refinements and Modeling and just a little tip, always remember to compliment your spouse once a day.
NEGATIVE	It was always really thin in places, and I just was never happy with the kind of beard I could naturally grow.
POSITIVE	Good morning, I am Adelina Vasileva and  this is the daily report from our newsroom in Varna.
NEUTRAL	The first ships from the United States Navy's  biofuel-powered fleet, officially known as the Great Green Fleet,  have sailed off to deployment in  the Western Pacific.
POSITIVE	The six ships are powered by an alternative fuel blend made of 10% biofuel  and 90% conventional petroleum fuel.
NEUTRAL	The deployment of the Great Green Fleet  is one of the U.S.
POSITIVE	Navy's five goals for reducing  the branch's energy and environmental footprint.
POSITIVE	Even though the 10:90 biofuel blend,  on which the ships sailed off, is much less greener than the 50:50,  with which they were tested, this small shift towards renewable energy  is still an improvement from several years ago.
POSITIVE	This is all for today and if you'd like to learn more, please visit us at eatglobe.com
NEUTRAL	So beyond the Prime Minister's statement, are you optimistic about the possibilities for advancing recognition of LGBTI rights in Kenya
POSITIVE	Let's use some of the creativity we talked about last week for this chapter
NEUTRAL	 I want you to imagine you are really really rich and you can have anything you want to have I want you think about might be a particular car, it might be a race horse it might be a house on the beach
POSITIVE	 In this chapter a lot of it's very very familiar
NEUTRAL	 You probably already know what you're supposed to do so this chapter is a reality check and a reminder that we need to take care of ourselves and that our health is our most prized possession
POSITIVE	 So 2:08review for most of you especially if you've taken the health three-unit health class which isn't required to transfer to a UC and even to transfer to a CSU you have a lot of options in that Area E but if you've taken it again this chapter will be just a good reminder
POSITIVE	 At this point in the semester it's a good time to think about those things we learned about keeping our brains healthy way back in a chapter on memory
NEUTRAL	 Remember was it sleep that you needed more? Or healthy vegetables? Or what is it that you need to keep your health your mind and your body healthy
NEUTRAL	 So think about it this week and think about getting back on track and making sure as you get busier and busier and as finals approach that you do not dream of neglecting to take care of your most magnificent possession
POSITIVE	 This week you also get a chance to take a little test to see how long you're going to live
POSITIVE	 I got 86 so I'm pretty happy with that
NEUTRAL	 My current habits will get me to the grand old age of 86
NEUTRAL	 Let's see how many if you can beat me and a think that's it for my intro
POSITIVE	 Think about a possession that you would like to actually own
POSITIVE	 I want you imagine maybe even close your eyes and imagine that you have that possession
NEUTRAL	 How would you feel and how it would be to have that item in your life and now I want you to imagine how you would take care of that object If it was a car, for example, I know a lot of you have dream cars how would you take care of ti? Would you read the instruction manual? Would you make sure it had tune ups? Would you polish it to perfection and make sure it was always in its prime state
NEUTRAL	 Maybe and those of you have children I want you to think about how hard you strive to be the best parent you can be
NEUTRAL	 You try to buy healthy food and take care of that child or what about a pet? What did your pet have for breakfast this morning? This chapter is all about health and as you can see what I'm trying to get to here
POSITIVE	 We know that good health is more important than anything
POSITIVE	 It's more important than that race car or that race horse or that magnificent house
NEGATIVE	 People who are sick or who don't have good health would give all away to have good health and yet how well do we take care of ourselves? Do we read our instrucion manual? Well we don't come with one but do we read articles about health and how to eat well and take care of our bodies? Do we eat well do we sleep do we do all those things we know we're supposed to do
NEUTRAL	Getting out from liberalism does not mean to get out from the political vision of Benedetto Croce, which liberal political vision, in those days, was the philosophical legitimacy of the political world of the bourgeois civilization, the world of Goethe and Mozart, the world of the great bourgeois culture.
NEGATIVE	Um when an applicant asks how much do I have to do, um, that shouldn’t sound very good to them um because anytime you’re um presenting yourself or entering a professional school you uh really should be an individual that kinda goes above and beyond the call of what you have to do or what the basics are.
POSITIVE	Um and so I know there are some programs that may require a basic number of shadowing or volunteer hours um but I really think you should do it because you’re interested in it um and you, you, you want to enhance yourself uh in order to make yourself potentially a better doctor down the road in our case.
NEUTRAL	Uh and so, you know, anytime I hear uh “how much do I have to do” with regard to volunteering, um, it’s probably not gonna be uh, uh good quality indicator if you’ve been doing it because you had to do it.
POSITIVE	Uh so please do volunteer work because you’re interested and you want to make a difference in other people’s lives and you’ll get a whole lot more out of it by following that.
NEUTRAL	Steven Wallace&gt;&gt; My name’s Steve Wallace, I’m the grocery, beers wines and spirits buyer for Sainsbury’s for Scotland and for Northern Ireland.
POSITIVE	I got to this position really by working in the retail industry for a long time.
POSITIVE	From pushing trollies in Tesco when I was 15, I’ve worked for Tesco’s, for Sainsbury’s, I went to Sainsbury’s as a trainee buyer in London about 12-13 years ago then went to work for Waitrose as a buyer, then took the opportunity to come back up to Scotland (because there aren’t many buying jobs in Scotland) three years ago.
NEUTRAL	The advice I’d give to anyone interested in a career in the food industry is to get involved with the suppliers at an early age – know your products.
NEUTRAL	So get a summer job at a local producer or farm, go to college and get your qualifications, be it relevant to the marketing side or retail, there are all sorts of degrees appropriate to the industry, and again work in a supermarket.
POSITIVE	It’s one of those things which funds you through university, but it gives you that real learning about products and speaking to customers and helps you understand the whole industry.
POSITIVE	It’s looking for quality products that we can sell or our customers demand, it’s looking for different and exciting ideas within the marketplace.
POSITIVE	The best part of the job, I would say, would be when you’re giving a big new contract or a new listing to, in particular, a small supplier because that’s where it means jobs.
POSITIVE	You could list a product in 20 or 30 stores, it could mean an extra five or six jobs at that particular supplier, so that’s always a good good moment.
POSITIVE	Your decisions in your everyday job, from seeing the quality products to listing them on your shelves, that affects jobs and communities, it goes all the way down the chain.
NEUTRAL	Sometimes you can underestimate the importance you can have to different suppliers and actually to employment, so it’s absolutely fundamental, it helps the whole Scottish food industry.
POSITIVE	There are great fun parts to the job about seeing great products, great suppliers, but actually there’s a lot of time needs to be spent doing the number crunching analysis, it’s a boring part but it needs to be done, it’s all part of the job.
POSITIVE	I think you need to have a good eye for a product, you need to be very patient, you need to be good at communicating because we have to communicate within our retail side and our head office, government bodies, all sorts of suppliers and other people, so being a key communicator is absolutely essential.

NEUTRAL	Songs and other genres of music are shaped by the percussion or a lack thereof, most notably, ambient music or defined ambient by the fact that they don't have noticeable aspects to it like percussion.

NEUTRAL	- Hi, it's Tim Allwood from Compass Property, here today to talk to you about Equity
POSITIVE	 What's Equity? Equity in your home is when you, well, it's what you own in your home
POSITIVE	 So if you take off what your home's worth, $500,000, say, if you owe $200,000, that's equity of $300,000, okay? So it's the difference between what you owe and what your house is worth, your equity
NEGATIVE	 The big problem is, a lot of people leave their equity sitting at home all day doing nothing, so to speak, in the cupboard
NEUTRAL	 While you go and work your butt off, and your equity's sitting there doing nothing
POSITIVE	 So what we propose you do is what most clever Australians do, is grab some of that equity, keep it secure, don't take all of it, just a good amount of it
POSITIVE	 So we use that to purchase the income-producing asset, an investment property
NEUTRAL	 So what you need to be clear about is you don't have to spent all your equity, and we can actually take enough equity to make sure there's a nice buffer
NEUTRAL	 So you don't, it's actually no money down for your investment property, we'll talk about that in another video

POSITIVE	 It's an engineered product overall There's half inch and three eighths options in terms of thickness 1 mil, 2 mil, 3 mil wear layer depending on what actual style you go with within Reward The longevity of the product will definitely depend on how thick of a wear layer you end up purchasing You're also going to get some good width options

POSITIVE	 You're going to get 48 inch average length
POSITIVE	 It is random so probably a little big above average in a lot of things you see out there so nothing overly spectacular about the board length
POSITIVE	 In terms of the finish, it's got a great finish, it has the aluminum oxide finish on it It's always important to keep in mind, whatever finish you buy it's going to scratch So yes this hardwood will scratch but it also has a very nice 25 year warranty on the finish The product itself, the maintenance is very very easy Just like you would maintain any other hardwood floor, you're going to sweep dust mop, wipe up spills and every once in a while you can damp mop Make sure you keep felt pads under furniture, things like that Installation really has a lot of options here

POSITIVE	The leadership that is in place, and about to be in place, with Deb Chew now taking on the role of creating this new version of the office and with Hanna Valantine, distinguished cardiologist coming from Stanford to be our new Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity, puts us in a place to emphasize this area of diversity and inclusion in new and creative ways.

POSITIVE	We are in a circumstance here of kind of running a small town ...a wonderful town.

NEUTRAL	[music] Because I only finished two books in February, I will not be posting Monthly Minis video.
NEUTRAL	A lot of the sorta hallmarks of your average mystery novel are not really in this one.
POSITIVE	For instance, there is really no way of knowing who did it in this one until it's actually revealed by Sherlock Holmes who had committed the crime.
POSITIVE	Really liked all the stuff that was told from Dr. John Watson's perspective.
POSITIVE	There were some really great quotes in the sections that took place in London.
NEUTRAL	But in the sections that took place... elsewhere (because I'm trying to be vague so I don't spoil anyone)... I just didn't quite get as into it.
NEUTRAL	It was a little bit too jarring when it happened and all of the sudden we were in the flashbacks and that I was like, "Did I read the wrong page?
POSITIVE	What is going on?" I found Sherlock Holmes to be a lot more likeable than I think most adaptations portray  him and I don't know if maybe he gets a more... difficult, shall we say, personality in the latter mysteries but in this novel I  thought he was a fairly likeable character.
POSITIVE	He has so much personality that really comes through, even though I would argue that most the other characters feel somewhat one-dimensional.
NEUTRAL	Instead you're gonna get two separate videos that are going to have individual reviews for both books I read in February.
NEUTRAL	I can't really tell Lestrade and Gregson, the two police detectives, apart and it's pretty clear that Watson is just sorta supposed to be the everyday person who is our insider look at the dazzling brilliance of Sherlock Holmes.
NEUTRAL	Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson's interactions are more memorable than Dr. Watson as an actual character.
NEUTRAL	I do agree that it does feel like Doyle didn't really know anything about Mormonism and yet he tried to write Mormonism into this mystery.
NEUTRAL	 The body is unmarked by violence, but on the wall a mysterious word has been written in blood.
NEGATIVE	I purchased a purse at a store that had a tag with a price on it and I found out later that they overcharged me what the purchase price was.
NEGATIVE	So when I argued with them and argued with my credit card company, they refused to reimburse me for the difference so I made a complaint with the Consumer Affairs.
NEUTRAL	And within about a month or so, I received a call from the store and they told me that they will refund me the difference.

POSITIVE	So actually, since I've moved to Denver, I climbed my first 14,000 feet mountain, went rafting, and I also tried snowboarding for the first time this winter.
NEGATIVE	This lesson is titled Whose Life is it Anyway and it begins with an article a short article that I wrote in direct response to the language that I heard many of my, as I always say, more traditionally inclined therapists using with their gay identified clients continually referring to this thing called internalized homophobia.
NEUTRAL	This article really emphasizes the importance certainly from a narrative perspective of engaging externalizing conversations in our work.
NEUTRAL	The article or the lesson then goes on to identified certain what I call fluid practices that ground me in the work, along with an article documenting my work with particular clients suffering from the effects childhood sexual abuse and our work over a period of about nine months.
NEUTRAL	We also included an article on called Linking lives Around Shared Themes written by Chris Behan which engages narrative practices in a group context.
POSITIVE	It's a great example of that kind of work and the lesson ends with an award-winning documentary film about the remarkable ability of people to come together and form community even in the face of what could otherwise be described as a devastating tragedy So enjoy and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

POSITIVE	We've raised up over 70 six figure income earners now on our team over a thousand people that have earned that free ViSalus paid for BMW payment and because of our simple system.
POSITIVE	A team that's always looking for the newest story that the newest brightest that as the most potential giving them everything that we got.
NEGATIVE	But certainly it has to be viable, because if you think that you're going to spend money doing it locally, you're going to spend a lot more money doing it on the road.

NEUTRAL	They're going to do a lot more research, especially online.
NEUTRAL	They're going to look for the best price, the best deal they can get.

NEUTRAL	 This is Tom Floyd, Vice President of Real Estate at Member One Federal Credit Union bringing you another Member One Money Minute
NEUTRAL	 Today, I want to talk to you a little bit about credit
NEUTRAL	 A lot of people ask, "What kind of credit do I need in order to buy a home?" Well, there's no set answer, but there's a couple of things we look for
NEUTRAL	 We kind of look for 640 as kind of a minimum score that we're trying to have in order to get an approval, and obviously, the higher the score, the easier your approval will be
NEUTRAL	 The score is a reflection of how well you pay your bills, what type of credit you use, how many inquiries you have, what are the balances of your credit cards to your maximum limit
NEUTRAL	 So, you want to be very careful about those items
NEUTRAL	 Another general tip is we're looking for three credit items to be open for a minimum of 12 months, so if you don't have any credit, you need to go out and borrow some money to build up your credit history before you go get a mortgage, which is the biggest piece of credit you'll ever get
POSITIVE	 And at Member One, we also offer, besides mortgages, personal loans, we have credit cards, we have starter loans, so we have everything that you need to help build your credit if you're at that point
POSITIVE	 So, hopefully these credit tips will help you so when it's time to buy your home, your credit will be in great shape and you'll have no problem at all

NEUTRAL	What we did do was review more than 10,000 pages of documents including several detailed witness statements.
NEGATIVE	As there are related prosecutions before the court, we are not in a position to detail the reasons for our decision, but the public can be completely and utterly confident in what ASIC did.
POSITIVE	More broadly, ASIC's record on punishing wrongdoers is solid.
NEGATIVE	So, there is no need to fight for all this at all

POSITIVE	I'm Dr Graham Pike from the Department of Psychology at the OU and I'm a forensic psychologist.
NEUTRAL	Forensic psychology is concerned with all aspects of crime in a criminal investigative procedure.
POSITIVE	Witnesses quite commonly will forget certain pieces of information, not be able to remember details and will change their mind about what happened and when, but that should be expected.
POSITIVE	One thing forensic psychologists have done is look at witness memory, particularly how we can help the police to get the most out of what a witness has seen of a crime.
NEUTRAL	One thing that might happen is that we allow a witness simply to recall everything they can without interrupting them.
POSITIVE	By doing that the witness can remember more accurate information.
NEUTRAL	One of the reasons it's so important to look at witness memory is there's an expectation that our brains act a bit like a computer.
POSITIVE	So the information goes in, is stored perfectly and can just be retrieved perfectly.
NEUTRAL	and so we worked with OFGEM and the Department of Energy and of Climate… - Department of Energy and Climate Change that administers this
NEUTRAL	to work out a method whereby glass could become part of this process, if you like
NEUTRAL	We’ve been successful in doing that
NEUTRAL	The fundamental opportunity that we identified through this process is that
NEUTRAL	there are 13 million homes in the UK that have windows that were fitted more than 10 years ago
NEGATIVE	which are not very efficient windows and we identified that by replacing the old

NEUTRAL	"Here, invisible yet strong, was the taboo of the old life," Golding writes
NEUTRAL	"Round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law
NEGATIVE	" But those taboos break down pretty quickly and soon Roger is torturing other boys, a job he really enjoys
NEUTRAL	So much for your mom telling you that bullies are just insecure
NEUTRAL	What Golding is saying is that we're all bullies
NEUTRAL	We'll act viciously as long as we think we can get away with it
NEGATIVE	Before he's killed, Piggy, the fat asthmatic intellectual, asks, "What are we
NEUTRAL	" "Humans, or animals, or savages
NEUTRAL	" And Golding's answer is D -- all of the above
NEUTRAL	In Golding's world view, the authority and social structures of what he calls civilisation bind us together, and without those, the boys on the island never really have a chance

NEUTRAL	Hey everybody what's up I wanted to do a review of the new Kanye West, Paul McCartney and Rihanna Collaboration Four Five Seconds.
NEUTRAL	It got released about a day or so ago and the twittisphere is exploding with it so lets talk about their new song.
NEUTRAL	There's no drums in the song, this song unlike Only One doesn't sound like there are any keyboards there's no drums and no auto tune and it's basically Paul McCartney playing acoustic guitar and Rihanna and Kanye share vocal duties going back and forth.
NEGATIVE	And Rihanna's vocals are definitely pretty screechy on this song and Kanye has some pretty tuneless singing.
NEUTRAL	Kanye has never been the greatest singer in terms of his singing voice and that's probably why he relies so heavily on auto tune, but this song reminds me of that awful collaboration that Michael Jackson did with Paul McCartney.
NEUTRAL	Both artists are amazing talents, but together they didn't really have amazing song writing capabilities when they were working in the same space and this song sort of feels like this too.
NEUTRAL	In fact this song sounds like something i would hear if i went to some hippy coffee shop that only served free trade coffee and ran into three strangers that were just jamming together and came up with this song.
NEGATIVE	If Kanye West, and Paul McCartney's name and Rihanna's name wasn't attached to this song and the song just got released by three unknown people and sounded the same it wouldn't be getting the attention it's getting.
NEUTRAL	I give this song a 2/5. I'd like to know what you guys think leave your comments in the section below.
NEUTRAL	Now this is the second collaboration that we know of that Kanye West has done with Paul McCartney.
NEUTRAL	If you have a question about anything you just Google it and you can find so much information at your finger tips, but i guess people choose not to use common sense to do that but anyways getting back to the song.
NEGATIVE	I wasn't a fan of Only One I thought it was pretty disappointing to me and this song I didn't have much expectation going in.
POSITIVE	I am a fan of Paul McCartney and Rihanna , but i am not a big Kanye fan, but i do recognize that he is a pretty talented guy.
POSITIVE	I don't need that appeal like you guys allow you guys come here for the cinematic stuff for the positivity Which is what I love to spread the relationship stuff
POSITIVE	The corking is the messin around They always having fun
NEUTRAL	So, because it doesn't make any sense, I'm not going to remember any of it.
NEUTRAL	In this module, we're are focusing specifically on spatial data.
NEUTRAL	 We start by taking a little bit of a refresher on the three components of the ArcGIS software.
NEUTRAL	 And pay attention to where error is introduced and the limitations of both data models.
NEUTRAL	The last part of these lecture slides really dive into those key concepts related to ArcGIS and GIS in general.
NEUTRAL	 Make sure you understand the difference between layers and features, and shapefiles and feature classes classes, and feature classes and feature datasets.
POSITIVE	ArcMap allows us to display these not nonspatial features, for example population of the state, population change...  what else can we display... disease  rates.
NEUTRAL	 Now in Module 1 you were exposed to ArcMap and ArcCatalog.
NEUTRAL	 All of these things can be stored within the shapefile data as an attribute table-- can be displayed.
POSITIVE	 This is what makes GIS software so powerful It is also-- In this section we also talk about knowing how good quality your data are.
POSITIVE	 So making sure we know where to find metadata, what types of metadata makes your data better or how do we understand who produced the data what the projection was.
NEUTRAL	 And in this class we really only use shapefiles or feature classes.
NEUTRAL	 So make sure that you understand what separates shapefiles and feature classes-- feature classes are stored in geodatabases, shapefiles are not.
NEUTRAL	 So you should remember that ArcMap is the component--the main component of ArcGIS.
NEUTRAL	 If you open up your open up your Window Explorer files versus opening it up in ArcCatalog.
NEUTRAL	  You will see you have several files associated with each data set.
NEUTRAL	 So pay attention to the files that are associated with it and how to move data from place to place, regardless of the data format we're looking at.
POSITIVE	 This is where you create your data, edit data, view data, analyze your map, create maps, it is the workhorse of the ArcGIS program.
NEUTRAL	The second component is ArcCatalog is more focused on database management so you should remember how you search through the different datasets, change projection, added thumbnails, everything like that.
NEUTRAL	 And then the last part, ArcToolbox, the last component is the one we will be exploring towards the end of the course.
POSITIVE	Where we get into looking at very specific geoprocessing tools.
NEUTRAL	 Make sure you pay attention to the difference between our two key types of spatial data models vector and raster data.
NEUTRAL	Now that we've talked about whether your choosing battery powered or hardwired, you've got to determine how and when you're going to use this.
NEUTRAL	You can set your GPS to turn on a Monday through a Friday and not work on the weekends.
NEUTRAL	You can set it so that it's motion activated  -- The minute you move your car, the GPS turns on.
POSITIVE	You can also set it so that it's on every minute of every day.
POSITIVE	The beauty of it is no matter what you decide, you can log on to any computer as long as you have internet access, and you can see where your vehicle has been and what it's doing at any given time.
NEUTRAL	The thing about a conclusion is that it is simply a wrap up.
NEUTRAL	It is a brief restatement, not retelling the whole persuasive speech.
NEUTRAL	But when they're injured the heal with scar tissue and now they don't glide as much, right, and they create this knot in there
NEGATIVE	So it's very easily irritated again
NEUTRAL	So I'm going to do one more pass
NEUTRAL	Bring it out like this, arm out in front of you, and let's have you take your chin down
POSITIVE	Okay good now stop right there
POSITIVE	Let's put it on pause for a second okay
POSITIVE	And then the other thing you want to need is a little bit of a light of course we're shooting this here for Expert Village, we're lit and you can see me very clearly that's why on your video that you're watching me on right now looks great, the quality looks real good.
POSITIVE	Well that's important, you don't want to be doing it in a dark room.
POSITIVE	Even if it means getting a little desk lamp and aiming at you or aiming it at the ceiling and bouncing the light at you, whatever you can do to get a little bit of light in front of you will make your quality of your video that much better.
NEUTRAL	Now some computers nowadays even have them built in, of course this is an older webcam that still works great for what I'm doing but the newer webcams have better quality and they have microphones built right in.
NEUTRAL	These cameras cost under 20 bucks, you can certainly find them on different websites online or even go to one of your big box stores and one of big box electronic stores, they might charge you between 20 and 30 at most.
NEUTRAL	- [Voiceover] Yeah, but let me point out that you did say all white men
NEUTRAL	Before this we would've called this the Anti-Federalists or the Democratic Republicans
NEUTRAL	- [Voiceover] Okay, so Hamilton is a Federalist position
NEUTRAL	Jefferson is an Anti-Federalist - [Voiceover] Right
NEUTRAL	So, Jackson is unabashedly a racist
NEGATIVE	And his vision of manifest destiny really involves the eradication of all Native Americans
NEGATIVE	- [Voiceover] I mean, this is a really dark time for American Indian policy
NEGATIVE	This is when we see something called the Indian Removal Act, that is literally what it's called
NEUTRAL	Jackson's presidency is also marked by the Cherokee Diaspora, the forced removal of the Cherokee along what's called the Trail of Tears
NEUTRAL	So, before Jackson, do we really have the Democratic Party as an institution
POSITIVE	So I'm just gonna do it later today
NEUTRAL	You need to, most lenders require that you leave at least twenty percent equity in the house.
NEUTRAL	Go to one of the credit reporting agencies online, get your copy of your credit report.
NEUTRAL	Many times these corporate kits include sample Articles of Incorporation.
NEUTRAL	Hello, I'm Robert Todd and I'm here to answer the question, how to write Articles of Incorporation?
NEUTRAL	And you're going to have to decide in which state you wish to incorporate.
NEUTRAL	KPMG has released its latest employment figures for the UK in conjunction with the British Recruitment and Employment Confederation.
NEUTRAL	computer program efficiently, whereas low IQ might prevent you from doing so
NEUTRAL	Emotional intelligence, or EQ, has been defined in many ways
NEUTRAL	For our purposes, I define EQ as "the ability to process painful emotions in healthy and effective ways
NEGATIVE	Low EQ, on the other hand, might cause you to deal with your pain by drinking or drugging, self-cutting, catastrophizing, beating up on yourself, of falling into hopelessness
NEUTRAL	Thus, EQ is about one's ability to process painful emotions, whereas IQ is about one's ability to learn and solve problems
POSITIVE	Hey, what’s up?! Do you remember the session we did two weeks ago? Listen, next week there will be the opening of titan-gyms
POSITIVE	com The full range of materials will be waiting for you
POSITIVE	So if I say; if I'm talking to my best friend, I'm talking about this person who loves me, I say that he loves me; he knows me for who I am and he loves me, he can't help himself from loving me for exactly who I am.
NEUTRAL	This is my monologue from Queens Boulevard; I, what do I want; why am I telling my best friend this?
POSITIVE	In my mind’s eye; it's always good to pick a subject verb, a strong action.
POSITIVE	I see that he loves me; he knows me for who I am and he loves me, he can't help himself from loving me for exactly who I am and I love him too for exactly who he is.
POSITIVE	I have a real purpose objective; can't state the importance enough.
NEUTRAL	The human brain is not strictly an organ that develops according to genetics
NEUTRAL	Well the human brain also develops in response to the environment especially the human brain because most of our brain growth occurs after birth and not before
NEUTRAL	Whereas the human body is about 18 percent adult size
POSITIVE	So those first three years are hugely important
NEUTRAL	Now, which circuits develop and which do not depends very much on environmental input
NEGATIVE	So a child who doesn't see light, they will be blind after a few years because the visual circuits need light waves for their development, they just don't otherwise
NEUTRAL	May back in the seventies, but the marriage never ended up happening
POSITIVE	However, decades later we were shown that the two of them consummated the union… before the marriage itself
NEUTRAL	This makes the time that Peter walked in on his aunt WAAAAY less intense by comparison
POSITIVE	So hey, did you know that Wolverine and Squirrel Girl had a thing
NEUTRAL	Yeah, when Wolverine joined the New Avengers, their team leader, Luke Cage, decided to get a nanny for when he and Jessica Jones were going to be out fighting crime
NEUTRAL	After several interviews, it was decided that Squirrel Girl was the best candidate which led to this incredibly awkward scene when she crossed paths with Wolverine
NEUTRAL	Actually, none of that is what we're talking about
NEGATIVE	Right off the bat, the Lemon decision is a little complicated because it combines two sets of facts, although they both involve public money and parochial schools
POSITIVE	What it means is you can't be prohibited from being part of a certain religion, although it doesn't mean that any religious practice is okay
NEUTRAL	We are gonna anger a lot of Aztecs with this video, Stan
NEUTRAL	There are a number of cases that establish this distinction between religious belief and religious practice, but my personal favorite is Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye vs
POSITIVE	Hialeah, because I love saying Lukumi Babalu Aye
NEUTRAL	You probably figured out that what these two clauses mean in practice has been determined to some degree by Supreme Court decisions
NEUTRAL	There's a bunch of them, but probably the most important one is called Lemon v
NEUTRAL	The way of life can be free and beautiful,  but we have lost the way.
NEGATIVE	Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
NEUTRAL	We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery.
NEUTRAL	And so we're seeing that shift the dollars from the offline marketing to the online marketing.
NEGATIVE	There was a certain hostility to the play – no question about it.
NEUTRAL	But then he died, and within a year a small group of young people did it off-Broadway.
POSITIVE	I think it may have been the first off-Broadway production, ever, and it became a big success then – in a much worse production than the original one, but they were passionate, and they really were terrific.
POSITIVE	They had a great production in France with Simon Signoret and Yves Montand, I am told that created a real big clamor.
NEUTRAL	Of course we had fewer people here than they did in Europe.
NEUTRAL	So again we have a tool
POSITIVE	My name is Billy Gascoigne,  I’m an economist with the USGS Fort Collins Science Center  in Fort Collins Colorado I’m involved in incorporating  some of the economic and human dimensions research  for the Landscape Conservation Cooperative.
NEUTRAL	Well I think the biggest conservation challenge today,  is conservation itself as a land management strategy  going against competing land uses, largely driven by economic incentives.
POSITIVE	There’s a lot of value to that,  to these residents up here in this region.
NEUTRAL	 And again some of those values aren’t necessarily all that apparent,  but definitely important.
NEUTRAL	 From the land managers,  to county commissioners,  to the general public.
POSITIVE	 We hope the science will inform  land management decisions and maybe also  as more of an education piece Again highlighting those links, those social and economic links  back to landscape conditions that aren't always that apparent.
NEUTRAL	Our research is designed to  highlight and estimate the economic contribution  of some of the conserved habitats here in the prairie and pothole region.
POSITIVE	So we want to highlight those impacts and make that link between habitat conditions and social and economic impacts.
NEGATIVE	 For wetlands, for instance,   someone might say,  oh there’s not that much economic value to it.
NEUTRAL	 It can also have value just to the local residents in terms of open view sheds and quality of life.
NEUTRAL	And, this is important for the borrower, to have some underlying security for the loan that they have put forward to you, because more often than not, their a savings institution and they have responsibility to their depositors to make sure that the money that they have in their institution, is secured by underlying assets.
POSITIVE	Hi, I'm your Dean of the School of Education at Southern New Hampshire University.
NEUTRAL	Many teachers just aren't able to work all day and go to school in the evenings.

NEUTRAL	complications of decision making, temptation to sometimes make a pragmatic decision instead of a principled decision
NEUTRAL	It was all there, so I'm a history student
POSITIVE	I hope people will watch it because hopefully it's a good drama
POSITIVE	It's always a good place to start, but I think the obvious resonances I hope will make it interesting
NEUTRAL	one threw at burrito at me and I fell over
NEGATIVE	I looked down and thought I was looking at my guts when it was really just beans and rice
NEUTRAL	But the Pack promised to work hard, saying "If you put us in the sequel, we will practice, we will rehearse, we'll take it as a serious thing

POSITIVE	But how on earth did that happen
NEUTRAL	Cannon initially resisted the idea
NEUTRAL	Pepsi has decided not to advertise in the Superbowl anymore.
NEUTRAL	Remember the Drew Carey show Mimi always had the troll dolls but the thing to remember about that is there is a difference between personal items and items that are just to personal.
POSITIVE	As I was saying a little bit ago having a picture of my husband on desk is a little different than having a picture of husband in his boxers on my desk.
NEUTRAL	Tēnā koutou katoa, Talofa lava and good afternoon
NEUTRAL	 Welcome to EPIC conference 2016
POSITIVE	 Right here at this conference you have a huge opportunity to unlock the benefits of diversity
POSITIVE	 We have a full range of excellent speakers on the program including our very own Prime Minister the Rt Hon John Key
POSITIVE	 We have Wei Gao and Sir George Fistonich and they have typical migrant stories of struggle, hard work and success and I know in this conference centre there are many more stories of achievement that will play out going forward
POSITIVE	 Like Sir George and Wei, we need to harness the energy and innovation that diversity creates to support new business ventures as well as grow existing businesses
POSITIVE	 And you will receive expert insights as to the importance of marketing and customer relations
NEUTRAL	 I am encouraged that you will be making connections, and exchanging ideas that will help us unlock the benefits of diversity for New Zealand in a connected global market
POSITIVE	 I hope you Enjoy the conference, I hope you experience some of Auckland while you're there, And I hope that you get to explore the beauty of New Zealand and its people
POSITIVE	 As Minister of Ethnic Communities I welcome you all – especially those who have travelled from overseas and outside of Auckland
POSITIVE	 This conference is important to raise the visibility and awareness of migrant businesses
POSITIVE	 It is also about enabling local businesses to connect with other businesses both here and abroad
POSITIVE	 First it was a “supercity”
POSITIVE	 We have made it that way – and it’s a good thing
NEUTRAL	 Almost half of the population in Auckland today are Maori, Asian and Pacific peoples and there are over 200 ethnicities represented here
POSITIVE	 Superdiversity brings with it enormous benefits such as greater innovation, productivity and investment
NEGATIVE	And perservication as a result of climate change is going to cause big drastic problems for the future.
NEUTRAL	This next card is supposed to be the current that is coming into action, so the future that's happening soon
POSITIVE	It is the 8 of wands
NEUTRAL	Loss, theft, privation, abandonment, although another reading suggests hope and bright pa- prospects
NEUTRAL	So this is either loss or it's hope
POSITIVE	I am going to choose to believe that this card signifies hope
POSITIVE	That is how I am going to think of the future
POSITIVE	I am leaving behind the bad past and moving into a hopeful future where I can work towards the wheel of fortune
NEUTRAL	This is supposed to signify myself and my attitude towards
POSITIVE	Wow It seems that we have Banana Can I have something to eat this banana with
POSITIVE	This meeting was particularly important to the grantees because it moved them in their evaluation thinking from making sure that they had a product or solution that was of good enough integrity to use with patients to thinking much more broadly about the evaluation: How was this going to impact the physician?
NEUTRAL	How was it going to – the content and the use of ODLs – going to be detected in the individual care of a patient?
NEUTRAL	It is respect for others, it is fairness, it is the dignity of work, and it is a recognition that we all have to share in the benefits of development and growth.
POSITIVE	The ILO has highlighted that there is a link between social justice and a fair globalization; in fact we put together a Declaration on that issue.
NEUTRAL	The key question is that we have to move from a globalization that is unfair and unbalanced and unsustainable into something that actually people look at and say “hey, I’ve got a fair chance of being part of this”. That is not the situation today.
NEUTRAL	The crisis has made it more difficult and that’s why the struggle for social justice  - because it is a struggle - is so fundamental and so key.
POSITIVE	And there are many people in the world that understand and believe this and we have to get this into the economic system.
NEUTRAL	The essence of addressing social justice from the perspective of young people is to acknowledge that we have a generational debt to the young people.
POSITIVE	So adults that define the policies have to ensure that we put in place the polices that permit the young people to enter into jobs.
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately that’s not the situation today, that’s why we have to fight for it.
POSITIVE	When you fight for change, when you fight for social justice, you also took another decision.
POSITIVE	So it is not a question of being optimistic or pessimistic, it is just acknowledging that it is a difficult task and sometimes the current is less strong, sometimes the current is stronger but it will always be against the current.
NEUTRAL	Social justice is a way of reacting to a crisis but also of organizing society and the essence of the whole thing is that it is an approach, it’s a system, it is the conviction that certain values have to be there.
POSITIVE	Today it means recognition that one of the best ways to get to social justice is decent work, it is the dignity of work, the dignity of the human being, the stability of the family, the peace in the community that decent work gives you.
POSITIVE	I think that the essence of the way business has to approach social justice is to understand that it is also good for business.
NEUTRAL	That productivity and competitiveness leads to a fair distribution of the fruits of labour and this is the essence of the ILO approach.
POSITIVE	That you have a fair chance at whatever wealth you contributed to creating and every successful enterprise knows that.
NEGATIVE	BUT WE ARE STUCK HERE IN NEW MEXICO
POSITIVE	I WOULD LOOK TO ENERGY, CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY AS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR FUTURE

POSITIVE	If the topic is about how to take a cheap European vacation, do the main points and the sub points talk about how to take a cheap European vacation?
NEUTRAL	Staying in hostels, where to eat on the cheap, train travel that's less expensive -whatever it is, do those points match the speech and are they parallel?
NEUTRAL	Do you have student loans that are reporting past late payments on your credit report? Student Loans are the scariest kind of Debt
NEUTRAL	 You can't remove them through bankruptcy and if you don't pay them, they never fall off your credit report
NEUTRAL	 The way that it works is they will set you up on a payment plan, if you’re not already on one
NEUTRAL	 After you make 9 on-time payments to the repayment plan, it will automatically remove all of the past derogatory reporting from those student loans that were included in the forgiveness program
NEGATIVE	 Now, what if you paid all of your student loans on time, but they’re still reporting late payments? Then, what you need to do is, reach out to us and we will give you a free credit audit and consultation

NEUTRAL	 There is a huge problem that I see on hundreds, if not thousands of credit reports and it is student loans reporting past late payments when they were supposed to be in deferment
POSITIVE	 Today I'm going to show you how you can correct student loans that are reporting past late payments on your Credit
NEUTRAL	 Everyone gets in a bind with their student loans for a different reason
NEUTRAL	 There's not always going to be one solution what works for each person
NEUTRAL	 Even if the late payments weren’t because you were in deferment, there is still an option for you without having to pay some company a bunch of money to fix it
NEUTRAL	 Option 1 is the student loan late payment forgiveness program
NEUTRAL	 If you have past due lates on your credit from your student loan company, I want you to call the lender and ask them about the student loan late payment forgiveness program
POSITIVE	Have them practice it, refine it, work it out so that it feels comfortable, it sounds good, and it's easy to listen to.
NEUTRAL	Choose your points carefully that will capture your listener's interest, develop the points, and make sure it's very easy to listen to and gives your listener a call to action.
NEGATIVE	Believe it or not, people don't really want to listen to a long speech most of the time.
POSITIVE	And so you really have to do your best to capture the listener's interest in the beginning of the speech by connecting to an issue that's going to be of interest to them and of importance to them.
NEUTRAL	Now, the development of your speech is going to be a lot like developing an essay.
NEGATIVE	Jokes can be good, but they can also be very bad if they're not targeted directly, so, be really careful about how you use humor in your speech because it can actually end up doing more harm than good.
NEUTRAL	Deadpan is a form of comic delivery in which humor is presented without a change in emotion or body language.
NEUTRAL	Failure to include the context or to identify the contradiction results in the listener finding the dry humor unfunny.
NEUTRAL	However, the term "deadpan" itself actually only refers to the method of delivery.
NEUTRAL	Jon Benjamin Styles within deadpan Deadpan can vary in subtlety.
NEUTRAL	It may also take the role of mirror to characters who are unaware of their folly.
NEUTRAL	Some of this can be seen with the characters Britney and Kevin in Daria.
NEUTRAL	More subtle deadpan can test the observational limits of the audience and even play off the audience's awareness.
NEUTRAL	See also Blank expression Dark humor Minimisation Throwaway line Daria References
NEGATIVE	This delivery is also called dry humor or dry wit, when the intent, but not the presentation, is humorous, blunt, oblique, sarcastic, laconic, or apparently unintentional.
NEUTRAL	The usage of deadpan as a verb is recorded at least as far back as 1942. Examples Many popular American sitcoms use deadpan expressions to deliver dry humor, most notably Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development, The Office, Red vs.
POSITIVE	Some good current examples are the characters April Ludgate from the TV show Parks and Recreation played by Aubrey Plaza, or Bob Newhart as Arthur Jeffries in The Big Bang Theory.
NEUTRAL	Another example is the often philosophical comedy of Steven Wright.
NEUTRAL	Dry humor is often confused with highbrow or egghead humor, because the humor in dry humor does not exist in the words, their delivery, or both.
NEUTRAL	Instead, the listener must look for humor in the contradiction between words, delivery and context.

POSITIVE	 So, I'm very accessible
POSITIVE	 Feel free to email me, call me, or text me anytime you need help or support
POSITIVE	 So let's have a great semester, and I look forward to seeing your stories
NEGATIVE	Now that means that shares have now fallen out of buy range after clearing a 79.26 entry point last month.
POSITIVE	meanwhile Macy's is up around 1% continuing a five session win streak which is sort of an interesting juxtaposition for both department stores and off-price retailers, since off-pricers have generally been seen as outperformers in the retail space, while department stores have generally been struggling.
NEUTRAL	So after the close, we've got a couple of others for you, we've got teen retailer Urban Outfitters and lighting guys Cree, so keep an eye on this space.

POSITIVE	If you want to step up the quality of your production, we have useful videos in our VLOG.
POSITIVE	No editing, No hassel, No fuss, just videos to help grow your business, and remember we provide discount pricing for annual plans.
POSITIVE	You are one form away form away from making video marketing easy, affordable and productive.
NEUTRAL	Does the thought planning, creating and editing videos sound difficult and time-consuming?
NEUTRAL	Using annuity bonds, those are known for short, as a strategy.
NEUTRAL	Traders and bond dealers have gotten together with mutual fund companies, and actually bundled up various offers for various municipalities, with high specialties.
NEUTRAL	Many Americans do not have a household budget, so as a result, they're ending up seeing less a month left and less money at the end of the month.
NEUTRAL	Make those your main items as opposed to your income, and then make sure that there's enough of income to take care of those essential items.
POSITIVE	Make sure you have an effective line item schedule that you stick with, but don't be so critical on yourself that you can't allow some fun every now and then because it's very important to do that.
POSITIVE	And so I wanna start us trending upwards again, so that we can have more women in office.
POSITIVE	Recently we had a great event thanks to the former National Society of Hispanic MBAs, which is now Prospanica
NEUTRAL	 And the event was called Career Accelerator
POSITIVE	 It's important that you are practicing your stories because we are going to have a great opportunity here in Houston
NEUTRAL	 It was an opportunity for current MBA and graduate students to practice their interview and their resume skills
NEUTRAL	 A question that was asked a lot before, during, and after the event was: How to prepare for an interview? And there are several things that you have to do to be ready for an interview, but one important thing is to practice your stories
POSITIVE	 And one thing I tell people to help them understand what practicing their stories means is that they have to think of themselves as comedians
POSITIVE	 Comedians practice their material all the time, not because they are fake just because they want their audience to have the time of their life
POSITIVE	 That's exactly what you have to think of when you are going to an interview but instead of telling jokes you are telling your professional stories, you are telling the stories of the challenges you've faced in your professional career and you're gonna tell them the steps you took to overcome those challenges
NEUTRAL	 So always be thinking STAR method
NEUTRAL	 Situation, Task, Action, Result
NEUTRAL	 So that your stories can be efficient and effective in communicating what you wanna communicate
NEUTRAL	So be fair for both parties, you know make sure that you're not going to overwork your nanny and make sure that it's enough duties for her and it's not some outlandish thing like you know, washing your car or something like that.
NEUTRAL	So make sure that you write down your expectations, express them to the nanny and the you guys go extensively over the details and whatnot.
NEUTRAL	So my recommendation would be to do a contract with every nanny possible.

NEUTRAL	By monitoring the stream in various location along the path, you can see exactly where the faults occurred
NEUTRAL	For instance, it could be the satellite uplink, downlink, or a fiber system, or it could be at the input to the transmitter
NEUTRAL	The operator can actually see where the problem is occurring
NEUTRAL	someone coming from a stated non believing perspective treating what is too many people Sacred Scripture, you might get more friction and controversy there, too
NEGATIVE	I think it's a real question some people have about using the sacred scriptures of particular faiths to create modern entertainment and there's ethics in that, there definitely are
POSITIVE	I really look forward to discussing with my students their take on the "Noah" movie
NEGATIVE	More and more folks are using the social media outlets, both to find information, and frankly, to talk to other similarly situated individuals who've had the same disease, or the same problem with their child, or whose parents are similarly in a nursing home.
NEUTRAL	And I think those aspects of marketing are going to become much more important, again, in the wake of health care reform and what's going to happen with the influx of new folks and the influx of new products and services that will be covered, or frankly, not covered, because of changes in regulation.
POSITIVE	MALE SPEAKER: Frank, Jerome is asking, how do you feel in orbit after several months? FRANK DE WINNE: Well as you can see, Jerome, I'm feeling just great

POSITIVE	 So I'm having a good time here on orbit
NEUTRAL	 MALE SPEAKER: Karina wants to know, how much time does the crew spend working outside the space station? FRANK DE WINNE: Well Karina, actually, the crew spends little time working outside the space station, because it's very dangerous
POSITIVE	 If you go outside as well, you need to have one of those, a space suit
NEUTRAL	 And it's very difficult to maintain the space suit
NEUTRAL	 It takes a lot of work
NEUTRAL	 But it's also very hard to work inside of them
POSITIVE	 So therefore, we try to spend as least time as possible outside of the space station
POSITIVE	 This is why we use a lot of robotics tasks, for example
NEUTRAL	 It's what I did with the HDV and the experiments that we based outside of the Japanese module, Kibo
POSITIVE	 You can very nicely stay always in equilibrium after a couple of months
POSITIVE	 In the beginning, you're kind of going like all over the place

NEUTRAL	One is a tool that we developed which is called Star Com EQ, which is emotional intelligence research.
NEUTRAL	And what the content in those channels is doing to solve emotional need states.
POSITIVE	And it’s actually become a wonderful tool in really understanding what is driving consumers channel selection.
POSITIVE	And it’s not always rational, it’s very much emotional at times.
POSITIVE	The other thing that we have done is we are putting in place global communities, it is called the mic at Star Com, and these are global listening communities that we have where we can at any point in time put out questions to these communities.
POSITIVE	The next community we’re established is women and mom based.

NEUTRAL	 You know, kid's movies half the time don't work for me and half the time they do
NEUTRAL	 So I was curious as to how they could pull it off and, surprisingly, they pull it off really well in this movie
POSITIVE	 Of course I stayed until the end to look at some of the credits and the ironic thing is I saw that the writing credit was to Chris Weitz
POSITIVE	 Who is Chris Weitz, you may ask? He is one of the two brothers who directed the 1999 teen raunchy comedy film "American Pie"
POSITIVE	 [briefly chuckles] That's kind of like a contrast as far as content
POSITIVE	 A movie that had a lot of language and sexual content, this movie is toned down to PG
NEUTRAL	 Went from directing an R rated movie to writing a script for a family friendly audience
NEUTRAL	 Now the reason for that is because of stuff in my personal life, such as work, my best friend, and my girlfriend who I've been spending a lot of time with
NEUTRAL	 More power to him, I don't blame him
NEUTRAL	 So it's the typical story of Cinderella, the structure is the same and it's very faithful to the source material that it's attempting to do
POSITIVE	 I really liked the characters in the movie, the performances were really well, the visual effects were spectacular
POSITIVE	 I was amazed at how advanced they've gotten lately in movies when it comes to that

NEUTRAL	 Now, I'm going to be reviewing the newest "Cinderella" live-action movie
NEUTRAL	 I didn't know what to expect going into this movie
NEUTRAL	The Road Not Taken BY ROBERT FROST Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both and be one traveler, Long I stood and looked down one as far as I could to where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black
NEUTRAL	 Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back
NEUTRAL	Social marketing opportunities where just a few weeks ago we had a Twitter party to communicate with consumers about the importance of car care and what’s on the minds of women in particular.
NEUTRAL	And in a matter of an hour I was able to get hundreds of suggestions for products and questions about car care needs from women all across the country.
POSITIVE	It’s extremely important to Car MD to continually improve on our products and not just rest on, okay, we’ve innovated it and we’re done.
POSITIVE	My name is Lidia Vargas I've been coming to Lake Mead Dental for 5 years and I recommend Lake Mead Dental because the dentists are the best their personal is very kind and they're allways willing to solve any problems
NEUTRAL	Also for the good   of the majority population, education needs to be stimulated,  so that problems such as stealing, social problems, social assistance, are done with.
POSITIVE	 If we want to get rid of social assistance, if we want the   national budget to be richer and to develop the local infrastructure,  then we have to invest in education.
NEUTRAL	 Our only way out is to give our children to school, to teach   them, and to teach them to care about the others,  for the Roma that are not schooled, to teach them in   their turn, so that they are educated as well,  and to become a new community in which to live and be integrated.
NEUTRAL	We are very warm-hearted   people, we put a lot of heart in communication.
NEUTRAL	I think we are not well-known because this is not wished, according   to my experience of 12 years in the local council.
NEUTRAL	 Because we try, from our own initiative, to develop   the educational system in the Romani community.
NEUTRAL	 In some time, a lot of things can be   changed by creating the bases of education.
POSITIVE	It's not like Romeo and Juliet, where the lovers are sacrificed and then Verona is healed
NEUTRAL	I mean, who even survives this novel
NEUTRAL	Only the idle rich: Jordan Baker, Daisy and Tom Buchanan, Nick Carraway
NEUTRAL	They survive, and they are allowed to go on being careless
NEGATIVE	As Nick writes, "They were careless people, Tom and Daisy -- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness
NEGATIVE	" They aren't cruel or malicious, they're just careless -- they don't care too much about Myrtle or Gatsby or their daughter or even each other
POSITIVE	To live without a care in the world is supposed to be the dream, right
NEUTRAL	Everyone wants a care-free life
NEGATIVE	But Fitzgerald shows us the horror of this care-free life, how Tom and Daisy's inability to care is in some ways more monstrous than outright cruelty would be
POSITIVE	I came to Philips Design in the then newly group of social scientists, trying to come up with a more thorough research approach to designing.
POSITIVE	with a lot of designers who were thinking very well of themselves because they were really focusing on users already and then having to accept a new discipline into their processes.
POSITIVE	Then when someone's triggered, they will come up with asking the questions - "How did you come up with this knowledge?" "What were the methodologies?" "Where does this knowledge come from?" So, yes, it's communication and trying to come up with the right tools to communicate knowledge about users.
NEUTRAL	You see, Reston's campaign is saying that I don't have the experience to be president
NEGATIVE	 Let me tell you a story about my grandmother Every time that I used to date a new boyfriend She would ask his name and then she would go like "and what part of the city does he live in?" That was her way of asking if my boyfriend was white She was an out and out racist So I know the face of prejudice Governor Reston is telling me I don't have the balls to be president And he means that literally It's offensive It's offensive to me It's offensive to every woman out there who he is asking the votes for Tonight I am here stating that governor Reston is a sexist But you know what
NEGATIVE	 It's not even just about him going around and talking in codes about gender it's everyone Yourself included The only reason why we are here tonight in this interview in my house is because you requested it, right? it was entirely your idea and here still you are thinking that you are being welcomed into my lovely place You are thanking me for that This is the thing that you say to your next door lady that bakes you chocolate chips cookies This pitcher of iced tea is not even mine Your producer set it here And why is that? For the same reason that you call me a real life Cinderella story You are telling the world that I am a woman Without having to use the word And for you it's just an angle and I get it You might even think that it's innocuous But guess what? It's not
NEGATIVE	 Don't interrupt me while I am speaking You see, James, you are promoting stereotypes You are advancing this idea that women are weaker than men You are playing right into the hands of Reston And you know what? You are playing into the hands of anyone any imbecile out there that thinks women are not strong fit enough to be commander in chief Governor, I'm talking about you
NEGATIVE	 For seven years I served the United States Army Which is seven years more than he ever did A fact that you conveniently omitted from my intro, James
POSITIVE	I'd like to welcome the thousands of you from governments around the world, NGOs, public and private organizations, and elsewhere, who are taking part in the third biennial International Family Planning Conference.
NEUTRAL	For others, it's because their husbands or their communities simply don't support their use.
POSITIVE	That's why the United States and our partners must continue our life-saving work to advocate for sexual health and reproductive rights.
POSITIVE	That includes universal access to voluntary family planning.
POSITIVE	We'll need to continue investing in effective programs like the United Nations Population Fund and the State Department's Global Health Initiative.
POSITIVE	And we'll need to find new ways to remind people that when women and girls are better able to stay healthy and pursue new opportunities, they are also better able to contribute to the success of their families, their communities, their countries and the world.
POSITIVE	State Department, I look forward to hearing what comes out of this important conference, and I look forward to working together to bring about a healthier and more prosperous future for families from Addis to Adelaide, and everywhere in between.

NEUTRAL	I try to get my students to think, to be sophisticated thinkers who ask questions-- because there are no answers, there are no solutions, without questions.
POSITIVE	And I encourage them to be compassionate and nice, to pay it forward, to think humanly-- because there are no business problems, there are no business solutions, without humans.
POSITIVE	What's that one question you can ask on a first date to understand whether they are the one for you?

POSITIVE	I don't make any money for my YouTube videos
NEUTRAL	I'm paid as a producer at a TV station
POSITIVE	Now to practice these phases the easiest way is to talk to yourself
POSITIVE	And let me tell you - I am being serious while I say talk to yourself
NEUTRAL	Now how can you talk to yourself
POSITIVE	Just simply utter the words in your mind
POSITIVE	For example- you are eating something
POSITIVE	Just utter the names of the foods that you are eating in your mind
POSITIVE	For Example - fish, banana, bringle, egg plant
NEUTRAL	very fair cuz its maps mass is very fair in it like you never see him at Sage going yep 6

POSITIVE	[MUSIC] We perform about 600 robotic prostatectomies here at Johns Hopkins annually
NEUTRAL	We've had a robot here at Hopkins since the year 2000 longer than most institutions in this country and around the world
POSITIVE	We also have a robotics division within our department where we build new robots and test technological tools during surgery
POSITIVE	You're going to need to have kind of your outlet-type of presence out there, we're a beautiful match for that.
POSITIVE	We've got 88 million active users that are looking for traffic.
POSITIVE	As we've seen, if else statements really give you control over your code.
NEUTRAL	In fact, Lyme disease has many, many, many more symptoms and it's known as the great mimicker
NEGATIVE	It can mimic something like 300 different diseases and so classically can fit that
NEGATIVE	All these things, insomnia, depression, all of these classic symptoms we see in fibromyalgia patients
NEGATIVE	There’s still groups of people that you’re just not gonna reach with as much effectiveness on line as you are off line.
NEUTRAL	I think the one unique challenge is that, you know, we have access to so much data that probably corporate America even doesn’t have.
NEUTRAL	And then we have your entire, you know, millions of pieces of information on, you know, how individuals across the country vote, how often they vote, you know, their party registration, you know, how long they’ve been registered to vote that we kind of combine together with those.
POSITIVE	There’s a number of reasons, first of all of course, economically, intellectual property is extremely important for Europe.
NEUTRAL	But also for China, ironically, because both Europe and China on one hand are countries of old civilization, which have creativity, which have inventions.
NEUTRAL	And they do not have raw materials so their economy has to develop what the brains produce as opposed to what the earth produces, if you want to compare.
NEUTRAL	And therefore, one way or another, you go through intellectual property, be it for trademarks, be it for patents for technologies, be it for copyrights for artists, or be it for geographical indications.
POSITIVE	Hi, It's Lisa Treu with the Treu Group and we sold another property in Jupiter Farms.
POSITIVE	The Treu Group is having an amazing success in "the farms" and we would love to help you, too; if you're thinking of selling.
POSITIVE	We actually listed this property for two hundred and seventy-five thousand which the seller was just shocked that they could get that much.
NEUTRAL	My personal cell phone number is 561-352-3056 561-352-3056
POSITIVE	I believe entrepreneurship is the ability to think and create something that you would like to do in the world and try to make money doing it.
POSITIVE	The freedom to follow your dreams, to work with people that you like to work with.
NEUTRAL	Entrepreneurship is about spotting a problem, spotting a need, and figuring out how to address that and then how to convince those people with that problem, with that need, that you have the solution.
POSITIVE	Actually I think the most successful entrepreneurs start with the idea that they're gonna serve others.
POSITIVE	Finding problems to solve and trying to make the world a better place it's a lifelong pursuit.
NEUTRAL	you would describe it as a movie about Hannibal Lecter
NEGATIVE	I'm ASIC Commissioner John Price There has been a lot of reporting on ASIC's investigation into the share trading of David Jones two directors and the proposal from Myer.
POSITIVE	ASIC has examined this matter thoroughly, including this proposal and decided there is insufficient evidence to take enforcement action.
NEUTRAL	We also use independent experts who have experience in the markets, particularly on materiality.
NEUTRAL	But at the end of the day, the evidence we uncover needs to stand up in court.
NEGATIVE	Where there is this evidence we will pursue insider traders no matter who they are - from the Chairman of the Board through to junior staff.
NEGATIVE	My message on insider trading is this: it is a crime that undermines the integrity of Australia's capital markets.
NEGATIVE	This decision is not an exoneration or a tick of approval and if more evidence comes to light, the matter can be re-opened.
NEGATIVE	Generally, there are four things ASIC must prove for any insider trading case.
NEUTRAL	First, you need to show traders actually had the information.
NEUTRAL	Third, that the information was "material" in that it would have a material effect on the price or value of the company's shares.
NEUTRAL	And last, ASIC needs to prove the trader knew or ought to have known the information was material and not publicly available.
NEUTRAL	And that's because dairy milk requires about 12 times as much water as almond milk and that's something that people don't always consider
POSITIVE	We know that almonds do take a lot of water to grow, but dairy farms use 12 times as much water
NEUTRAL	So 2500 dairy cows produce as much waste as 411,000 people
NEGATIVE	That is how much waste is going into the groundwater, and how much waste needs to be dealt with
NEUTRAL	Oil stocks in general today struggled but things look better for parts of the biotech and pharmaceutical industries.
POSITIVE	Medivation jumped nearly 20% after Pfizer said it would buy the company and shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals were also up nearly 8% after the company appointed a new CFO.
NEUTRAL	Later on in the week we have earnings from discount retailers Dollar Tree and Dollar General.
NEGATIVE	Wait, that doesn't make any sense
NEGATIVE	In fact, they go on to explain that
NEUTRAL	"It's true that under a scheme like the one Sanders envisions, most people would lose the insurance they have today
NEGATIVE	But that's because everybody would have the new government-provided insurance instead
NEGATIVE	The whole point of a single-payer plan is to make sure that coverage is simpler, more comprehensive, and more reliable than it is today
NEGATIVE	" She also does another sleazy trick there
NEUTRAL	where she talks about how, "Well, what am I going to do
NEGATIVE	The states, I mean, they're rejecting the Medicare expansion under Obamacare
POSITIVE	When we're talking about a verb, a verb can happen now, a verb can happen later, and a verb can have happened in the past, then.
POSITIVE	That's basically it, and if you master tenses, you will be able to tell stories that span all of time, and I think that ability is kind of astonishing that language can express that sort of idea.
POSITIVE	If you can command all of these, you will be a time wizard.
NEUTRAL	What you are really going to be doing, what your income need is going to be or what you income goal is for example if you are earning and you are living on $100,000 your income goal on retirement is going to be $100,000, that would be your income goal.
POSITIVE	It could even be part time income but you are going to want to look at what your income is and then you are going to want to subtract out all the sources of income that you are going to have coming in and what that is going to do is provide you with that need.
NEUTRAL	Is it going to grow at 8% or 7% so that you can forecast what your nest egg is going to be when you retire.
NEUTRAL	I'm going to tell you a personal story about myself
POSITIVE	So all the cellists heard that this great Russian cellist was coming and we went we heard him play Sinfonia Concertante of Prokofiev that night
POSITIVE	And I tell you he completely blew us away
POSITIVE	I'm the author of "How To Save Your Stuff From A Disaster." I've been an expert in disaster mitigation for thirty-five years, and much of what I know and the services that I provide are important to your clients.
NEUTRAL	For instance, legal testimony and evaluation of legal entanglements could be important when trying to settle claims with clients.
NEUTRAL	Our evaluation of disasters and damage is basic to settling claims.
POSITIVE	Let me give you my cell phone number: 805-570-4140. Another way to stay in touch is to sign up for the blog and when I do updates, which is often, then you can look at the types of projects that we're evaluating and the people that we're doing the work for.
POSITIVE	The three key trends that I see coming up more and more in campaigns, I think overwhelmingly the number one, and it sort of [INAUD] everything is two way communication.
NEUTRAL	And it’s something we talked about today at the Think Politics event.
POSITIVE	But I think overwhelmingly people are looking to engage in on line, but also be engaged with.
POSITIVE	I think that people are being bolder and more courageous with their on line media, and that’s reaping really big dividends.
POSITIVE	It causes me to not do bad and put myself in a bad situation
NEUTRAL	It doesn't sound very sexy, but, think of it as wearing a "you were here" sign, this is where you start.
NEUTRAL	It includes leadership, marketing, finance, operations, HR, how we do these functions and how well they serve strategy.
POSITIVE	Look at where we come from so that we get perspective on where we're going.
POSITIVE	Wow!! That's really all I can say about the book I read this week
POSITIVE	 The book for this week was: Solve for Happy how to engineer your way to happiness by Mo Gawdat and he's the chief business officer of Google X
POSITIVE	 So if I can give you one suggestion get this book, buy it on kindle start reading it
POSITIVE	 You can take a random chapter and it will blow your mind and completely change the way that you see the whole world
POSITIVE	 I don't say this lightly but this is probably one of the best books I have ever read
NEUTRAL	 Now this book is pretty much what happens when you take one of the smartest people around and you tell them that that solve happiness
NEUTRAL	 This guy's an engineer and he takes it very systematically
NEUTRAL	 This isn't like any "self-help" book, it isn't a self-help book really
POSITIVE	 This is the systematic approach to solving happiness
POSITIVE	 He covers a wide variety of topics, things like your idea of time, your idea of death and he explains them so simply but so fundamentally that it will definitely change the way you look at the world and it'll improve the way that you see everything in your life and it will solve your happiness equation
POSITIVE	 You will definitely be a happier and better person after reading this book and I know that usually in these videos I summarize something
POSITIVE	 I give you guys one or two little tit-bits to take away, but I've been racking my brain trying to figure out what I was going to take out of this book to share with you and it's impossible
POSITIVE	 There is so much good information that I really couldn't pick one thing
NEUTRAL	Schmidt were recently appointed as partners in the firm's Asset Management Tax practice.
NEGATIVE	Or worse, an individual previously had good credit, but usually by no fault of their own, or perhaps by fault of their own, they have let their credit sag, and credit scores is very low.
NEGATIVE	So therefore, they still have the right to carry a credit card.
POSITIVE	As one of the leading personal injury law firms in Arizona, Phillips Law Group realizes it takes more than just one person to handle the challenges behind a personal injury claim
POSITIVE	 We’ve assembled a strong team of dedicated personal injury attorneys, investigators, paralegals and case managers, all to insure that your case is treated with the importance it deserves
POSITIVE	 Additionally, we have a wealth of information for victims of personal injury available on our website
POSITIVE	 Have any questions? Simply click the live chat button on any page and chat with someone 24 hours a day 7 days a week
NEUTRAL	So I usually work as an anchor in the evenings, reading those stories reporters have put together.
NEUTRAL	It's a lot of work, a lot of deadlines and a lot of stress, and you have to be willing to talk with people and not be afraid to go after interviews.
NEUTRAL	And then you'll notice that there's just this little brief period of time.
POSITIVE	There are multiple stages in this where the cell actually divides.
NEUTRAL	And then it goes through division and the end result is two little cells like that.
NEUTRAL	And maybe this one, I should've put that up here, there, because it's going to go through the process again.
NEUTRAL	And then this daughter cell is going to go through its own little process.
POSITIVE	If we were to throw the stages of the cell cycle on to a little circular image, what you would see is that the cell is in a stage called interphase most of the time.
NEUTRAL	So let's look closer at the actual process of interphase and break it down into its three little parts right here.
POSITIVE	For example, during interphase the cell's DNA looks like this.
POSITIVE	Dude, I feel like I've got Barkley the dog from "Sesame Street" hanging out here with me.
NEUTRAL	So most of the time that a cell is hanging out, it's in interphase.
NEUTRAL	 We're here talk now about hour 18, Texts J and K
NEUTRAL	 I can just bet that the citizens of Athens as they thought about Sophocles towards the end of the 5th century would have thought about how the old man and his very, very long career, which is full of sufferings as well as successes, could be identified with Oedipus as a cult hero
NEUTRAL	 And that's why at the end, I'm asking myself, well, who is the referent here? "The man did not need lamentations and there were no diseases that gave him any pain at the moment when he was escorted away
POSITIVE	 No, if there was ever any mortal who was wondrous, it was he
NEUTRAL	 And Greg, I was wondering these are part of the text I each of them
NEUTRAL	 And what do you think is new and different that you separated these parts out as separate focused passages? Well, what I want to emphasize about Text J, which is part of the Text I, it is this privileged position of Theseus as not only the founding hero of Athens as understood by the democracy in the 5th century, a version of the city of Athens but also his role as the initiator of all Athenians into what is called the Eleusinian Mysteries
NEUTRAL	 The reference to looking and hearing in a special way and which also involves not looking and not hearing, or can I say not visualizing and not verbalizing in other ways, is just pure mystery
NEUTRAL	 It's the way an initiator initiates worshippers into mysteries
NEUTRAL	 And that's why I want to come back to this part and try to make it understandable in terms of the fifth century of Athens, which was a very sophisticated period in the history of the city, but which is still clinging to these fundamental notions of what is a cult hero
NEUTRAL	 What is it like to be initiated into the mysteries of a cult hero? And how does that have to do with my role and your role as a citizen in [INAUDIBLE]? That's what this is all about and that's what, certainly, Sophocles is concentrating on and that's why he's so fascinated with Theseus
NEUTRAL	 And the flip side is that's also why he's so fascinated with Oedipus himself who is a character that he has brought to life in other aspects of that character's life
POSITIVE	 But here, in Oedipus at Colonus, Sophocles, who's in his 90s, really identifies with this wretched old man and how he's struggling with the difficulties of old age and the prospect of dying
NEUTRAL	But what Marx saw was that just as we freed ourselves from these natural constraints, we entangled ourselves in new social constraints
NEUTRAL	Let's go to the Thought Bubble to explore this some more
NEUTRAL	Working together allowed us to transcend our natural constraints, Marx argued, but the way labor is organized leads to massive inequalities
NEUTRAL	Think about it like this
NEUTRAL	Ten thousand years ago, basically everybody spent all day trying to get food
NEUTRAL	In this "primitive communism," as Marx called it, people were strongly bound by natural constraints, but socially very equal
NEUTRAL	But you also have the peasantry, who still worked constantly, making food
NEUTRAL	In fact, they spent a lot of their time making food for the nobility
NEGATIVE	That's not a natural constraint anymore, that's a social one
POSITIVE	- So what actually is personal branding? You hear people saying brand yourself and have a personal brand, but knowing actually what it is and how to do it is another story
POSITIVE	 So I am Tori from torimackle
POSITIVE	 So it doesn't matter what happens with those things because your business is always going to be long term and sustainable if it is about you and your personal brand
POSITIVE	 Everything else is like spokes that come off this central point which is you
POSITIVE	 Now, it may or may not be a surprise to you that you actually already have a personal brand
POSITIVE	 Your personal brand really is about your values and what you stand for and showing people that
POSITIVE	 So people can have a personal brand that actually don't have a business
POSITIVE	 If you've got a lot of people that look up to you as an authority in a certain area, as a leader in some description, then you probably already have a personal brand
NEUTRAL	 So a personal brand really is what you are known for by other people
POSITIVE	 So what do other people say about you? What do other people say that you do for a living? Those are the things that are actually represented in a personal brand
NEUTRAL	 Now, personal brands can actually open a whole bunch of doors for you and if you make your personal brand official and make it a business, then you can actually monetize those opportunities which is what is super exciting about a personal brand and it is really something that you build overtime
NEUTRAL	 A personal brand isn't something that you can not have one day and have the next day
POSITIVE	 You might make it more official, but you actually don't create a personal brand that doesn't already exist within you
NEUTRAL	 So that is my message for today
POSITIVE	 If you would like to leave your biggest takeaway message in the comments that you would be great
POSITIVE	 I love to hear what you guys think and pop over to my blog torimackle
POSITIVE	com if you wanna learn more about the what, the where and the how and everything to do with personal branding and setting up blogs and your add in to the online
NEUTRAL	 That is what I am going to talk about today
NEUTRAL	 So when you brand yourself, you are at the centre of your business
NEUTRAL	 Not your products, not the things that you recommend, but actually you
NEUTRAL	 So you probably heard this before, people actually relate to people and not businesses or companies
POSITIVE	 So with a personal brand, you can build a following of people that know, like and trust you
POSITIVE	 And when people trust you, they're now more likely to listen to your recommendations and want to know what it is that you are doing and how they can get the same thing or what it is what you are recommending because they trust that if they listen to you, they are going to get the solutions that they are after and it's the solutions that are the most important
POSITIVE	 With a personal brand, it doesn't matter what happens with social media or any company that you are associated with or any products that you recommend because you are at the centre of your business
POSITIVE	- So when looking at financial aid opportunities the first thing I looked at were scholarships.
POSITIVE	I applied to a lot and basically just did a quick Google search of scholarships that pertained to things that I was interested in.
POSITIVE	Applied to as many as I could, that was, you know, humanly feasible, and then I actually ended up getting a couple.
POSITIVE	Or, perhaps you're directing a play and you want to do the best directing job that you can.
POSITIVE	[Jazzy hip-hop music] If there's one thing that storytelling teaches us about life, it's that different objectives require different tactics, that achieve different results
POSITIVE	 We start creating daily content on YouTube for them
POSITIVE	 Sales start to go up, and they can see that the conversion is coming from the audience on YouTube
NEUTRAL	 But then as we get towards the end of the schedule, the end of the strategy, someone remarks, "We don't like that the number of subscribers to our YouTube channel isn't as high as we'd like it to be
NEGATIVE	" Or, "We don't like that there aren't more people coming from YouTube to our other social channels as we'd like there to be
POSITIVE	" Those notes provide an excellent opportunity to pivot towards new goals, but they were never the target objective
POSITIVE	 The target objective was to sell to 18-21 year old men on YouTube
NEGATIVE	 But at the end, not everyone's measuring success the same way
POSITIVE	 When your team all has the same objective in mind and is measuring success the exact same way, that becomes your North Star
POSITIVE	 It makes hard choices so much easier
POSITIVE	 It allows you to assess so much easier going forward
NEGATIVE	 One thing always leads to another
NEUTRAL	 If you're aiming for 18-20 year old men, and the only people engaging with your content are 35-50 year old women, hmm, something's weird
NEUTRAL	 We've gotta pivot here
NEUTRAL	 This is what storytelling teaches us
POSITIVE	 Differing objectives require different tactics, that result in different outcomes
POSITIVE	 Applying this theme to marketing reveals at least one universal truth: at the beginning of any project, make sure your entire team, especially the final stakeholders and decision-makers, are all seeing the same objective as the end goal
POSITIVE	 If you have different and conflicting objectives, you're gonna look for different tactics to achieve different results, and you're setting yourself up for incoherence
NEUTRAL	 Let me give you a hypothetical
POSITIVE	 Let's imagine that we have a client together, and their goal is to sell their product online to 15-21 year old men on YouTube
POSITIVE	 That's a clear objective
POSITIVE	 We lay out a 180 day strategy
NEUTRAL	In turn, we responded to the interference with our domestic affairs accordingly.
NEUTRAL	It was not our choice to wage a war of lists, but we cannot afford not to respond to blatant blackmailing.
POSITIVE	Hello Google, Hello People, and Hello Local Guides My name is Kim, and i'm a Master Student Researcher in The National University of Malaysia (UKM) Why i want to be a Local Guide?
POSITIVE	I travel places but not Sans Francisco, That's one of the reasons why i planned to join, i really want to join the Local Guides Summit because i want to meet different people from different places, listening to their reviews, feedbacks and recommendations, and also interact with people how to make a better place for future visits And i think that's all ! Arigatou Gozaimasu (Japanese Thank-You)
NEUTRAL	And this is where having a correct financial adviser who is aware of those ever changing platforms, they can keep your money moving in a right direction.
POSITIVE	Now, you've obviously picked your topic because you're passionate about it, and you've picked your topic because your audience will like it.
POSITIVE	And the ability of advertising, again, whether it's from a hospital, a physician, a drug company device, needs to be specific enough to satisfy their needs for both basic information and a direct link to what their concern.
NEGATIVE	Maybe it's your co-founders, maybe it's people that raise money from investors.
POSITIVE	Sometimes, it's you go to pitch competitions that's also a good way to practice but the more you say your story, the better it will become over time.
NEUTRAL	I want to find out about Payne gas furnace consumer reviews.
POSITIVE	This is your lucky day, oh Danny boy, I know quite a bit about Payne gas furnace consumer reviews.
NEUTRAL	Yeah, this is one of the things that you have to really think about when you purchase the Payne furnace brand.
NEUTRAL	I am almost afraid to ask this, but what are some of the other good and bad things about this furnace brand?
NEUTRAL	I think that 41 percent favorable opinion means I should look to another brand for my furnace.
NEUTRAL	Well, if you considering the purchase of Payne gas furnace, only 41 percent of consumers have a favorable opinion of them.
NEUTRAL	They say that the furnace, while affordable, often breaks and that the parts are often not covered under warranty, with little help from Payne.
NEUTRAL	Although some consumers point to the fact that the furnace is a reliable, it just depends on who you choose to listen to I guess.
NEUTRAL	There will be a time when there's no telephone, there is no computer, there is no online, it'll just be a communication channel.
POSITIVE	What Speakers Do Part 1 of 4 Before we can teach speaking to language learners, we need to understand the speaking process for native speakers and realize ways it is different from writing, which is also a production skill.
NEGATIVE	Granted, we all have met someone who never seemed to alter what they were saying based upon other peopleÕs comments, but that is someone who either has a story they want to tell and is unwilling to take any conversational detours or else they lack the language or cognitive abilities to do the necessary language processing that allows appropriate reaction to the interlocutorÕs comments.
NEUTRAL	Without some basic rules, most native speakers would find themselves lost most of the time, so what hope is there for non-native speakers.
POSITIVE	Well, native speakers have production strategies, or tricks, that they use to make the process smoother.
NEUTRAL	Spontaneity Both writing and talking involve an audience, but in writing, the audience either does not respond directly to the author or does so long after the writing has occurred.
NEUTRAL	For the purposes of this lecture series, I want to just consider conversation and not public speaking which has more similarities to writing.
NEUTRAL	This interlocutor, the person we are talking with, may ask a question or offer words of encouragement.
NEUTRAL	The speaker needs to answer the question or encouragement while continuing with the information they are sharing.
NEGATIVE	It is the issue of unstructured interaction that makes conversation so challenging.
NEUTRAL	So this week we're going to be looking at a topic  that should be of interest to those of you who have thought about or have previously dealt with owning or helping manage a business, and that is forms of business ownership.
NEUTRAL	So we'll look at things like what is a sole proprietorship.
NEUTRAL	What's the difference with the not-for-profit organization.
POSITIVE	So for those of you who are interested in starting your own business or dealing with entrepreneurship this is definitely a topic that you need to pay close attention to.
POSITIVE	﻿If your company is growing
POSITIVE	 If you're adding more people to your team, or if you've just already got a decent sized business
POSITIVE	 Both of those books have stuff on meetings
POSITIVE	 And at the end of the day, what I found is that all fast-growing companies that are successful have a regular rhythm, and are in a really cohesive structure for how they are meeting
POSITIVE	 They don't just willy-nilly have meetings at random times
NEUTRAL	 They have daily company meetings
NEUTRAL	 They have weekly company meetings
POSITIVE	 They have different one-on-one meetings
NEUTRAL	 They have different quarterly meetings
POSITIVE	 And the meetings are happening with a real rhythm and a real structure
POSITIVE	 Like I said, not just randomly
POSITIVE	 So what we ended up doing in our company
POSITIVE	 Then you're probably thinking a lot about how your company can have more effective meetings
POSITIVE	 People ask me about this a lot

POSITIVE	The world we're in is one where New Zealand is increasingly succeeding because it's so resilient, our economy is more adaptable and flexible, and the Government is going to keep driving in that direction.

POSITIVE	We're making it easier for tourists to get visas and visit America.
NEUTRAL	However, 'food' lets me know that now I am going to talk about the food aspect of recycling or whatever my topic is.
NEUTRAL	You are also going to commit to memory, the very first line of the introduction, which is your 'attention-getter' and the very end of your speech, the last line or two of the conclusion.
NEUTRAL	This is so that you can make eye contact with your audience in the first line and the last line, but everything else will just simply be notes of an outline.
POSITIVE	you get the tools necessary to do a great job in something you love
POSITIVE	a lot of people, they write a beautiful speech, and they're just not sure how to communicate it
NEUTRAL	 Its hard - you don't know what to do
POSITIVE	 You want to make a personal connection with each and every one of them
POSITIVE	 Try varying your gaze every few seconds to different parts of the room and that will make a huge difference in peoples ability just to interact with you and feel like they're being personally spoken to during your speech
NEUTRAL	 It can get a little intimidating looking into the eyes of complete strangers, especially because people tend to have their tv face on when they're watching a speech they're just deers in the headlight kind of thing
POSITIVE	 So one tip we can give you is to look at the friendly faces - focus on a few key people in the audience who are smiling, who ARE engaged, and just keep alternating between them when you're looking during your speech
POSITIVE	 Tip number 3 - you've lost your notes, you're making eye contact, that's great
NEUTRAL	 Now you have to make sure you're watching the clock
POSITIVE	 Stories are fantastic but they can also be long winded and drawn out

POSITIVE	 Of course if you've got an amazing story, and amazing connection with the groom or bride it can go a little longer
POSITIVE	 But generally, the shorter, the more people are going to appreciate it, and the better they're going to be engaged
POSITIVE	 Once you've timed your speech and you know how long its going to be you go a long way in keeping peoples attention
POSITIVE	 And finally our last point in giving a strong, confident speech, is to be conversational
POSITIVE	 You don't need to have every little word scripted out
POSITIVE	 If you're telling stories and you're talking - just try to stay natural
POSITIVE	 Keep your body language active, don't stand rigid at the stage, and just relax
POSITIVE	 Pretend its a conversation between two people not a conversation with 500 other people
POSITIVE	 A speech shouldn't really be a speech - it should be more of a conversation
POSITIVE	 Each member of the audience should feel like they're being personally spoken to
NEUTRAL	 So how do you give a speech that is confident, funny, debonair and charming? Well it all comes down to execution our first tip in execution - lose those notes! If i'm looking down at my paper all the time, its really hard to form a connection
POSITIVE	 If you do that - you keep it conversational, you use stories, you make eye contact, you lose those notes, you're going to give an incredible wedding speech
POSITIVE	 So feel confident and enjoy this opportunity to tell the bride and the groom how much they mean to you
POSITIVE	 You're going to do great! If you still aren't sure how to write your wedding speech, head back to our previous video: the 5 keys to writing a great wedding toast
POSITIVE	 You're just not going to register as much because it doesn't seem real
POSITIVE	 So lose those notes, buy instead of having a whole script that you have to get through - having a few key points that you illustrate with stories
POSITIVE	 Stories are easy to retell without needing notes because you already know them
POSITIVE	 So limit yourself to using stories, and your speech is going to be much more effectively communicated, and you're going to feel a lot more confident giving it
POSITIVE	 Second point when you're delivering a speech is eye contact
POSITIVE	You want to make sure that you're looking all around at the various guests in the room

NEUTRAL	Once someone goes at the buffet, everybody can go to the buffet

NEGATIVE	But little did Witherspoon know that she was peaking, as she found herself starring in a string of box office flops for the next few years
NEUTRAL	In fact, she STILL hasn’t been able to climb out of her box office slump
POSITIVE	So again, like Cotillard, at least she can still hang onto her artistic reputation with this nomination
POSITIVE	But one thing that is different this time around - and from Cotillard - is that this nomination also helps give Witherspoon some credibility as a producer
POSITIVE	Wild actually has TWO Oscar nominations - also Laura Dern for Best Supporting Actress - plus what’s more Witherspoon produced Gone Girl for which Pike is nominated

NEUTRAL	But when we use the term environmental justice we need to do what's right.
NEUTRAL	And that does require looking at the good of the whole and not just yourself.
NEUTRAL	And that means I may have to accept that there is a wind turban that's sitting on my back hill in my own backyard and not think it has to be in somebody else's backyard.
NEUTRAL	The rules of timing follow a system of priority, which will be explained in the process of a flow chart.

POSITIVE	What should I do?] Answer: Candidates always want to know exactly what we're looking for so they can perform exactly to our specifications.
POSITIVE	And even if your group doesn't seem to be 'getting it,' don't worry!
POSITIVE	We're not evaluating the group as a whole, we're looking at how you communicate and interact within the group that you're in.
NEUTRAL	[QUESTION: Soojin, this whole process the application, the resume, the team exercise all of it, has me so nervous.
POSITIVE	If I blow it at the team exercise, should I kiss my chances of cheering "GO BLUE" goodbye?] Absolutely not.

NEUTRAL	I don't have anyone, like, locally around me that likes to make videos like that that I could collaborate with.
POSITIVE	So to be in one space for a week gives me the most awesome opportunity to collaborate with other YouTubers and people who are crafty and that cook and knit and just.
POSITIVE	I've been loving meeting them and brainstorming ideas and seeing different ways that we can work together.
POSITIVE	Just wanted to give you guys a heads up that you are going to see some kind of different style of videos from me over the next little bit.

POSITIVE	Customer Segmentation and Relationship Management It's absolutely critical that you have a database of your customers.
NEUTRAL	But you should consider having your customers in a proper relational database that enables you to manage a variety of contact information and profile information about them, something Excel does not do to well.

POSITIVE	Online Content Marketing your product is essential and there are so many great ways you can market your product at very low cost.

NEUTRAL	One of the things that I started doing recently is actually recording all of my lessons.
NEGATIVE	Make no mistake; it’s not going to be the government alone that gets us there, as I said.
POSITIVE	It’s going to be innovators, workers, entrepreneurs, those of you who’ve been hammering away at this challenge for many years, and frankly, because of that, who have, without a lot of incentive heretofore, compressed the cost pricing now to where it is almost competitive.
NEUTRAL	And sometimes they have needs that they're not vocally expressing.
NEUTRAL	I think conversely or in addition, what we need to make sure that we're doing is helping our consumers to understand that we do offer certain services.
NEUTRAL	&gt;&gt; I do see picky eaters but I see everything from a typically developing kid with picky eating to kids that have significant developmental or medical issues who have not learned how to eat because of their developmental and medical issues.
POSITIVE	So the initial visit, when parents come in, they can expect just to be asked a lot of questions and their kid gets to play.
POSITIVE	If the kid is old enough to participate and answer questions, if they want, they can but it's just talking.
NEUTRAL	The second session, I ask the parents to bring in food and we actually start feeding the kid then and I observe how it usually goes now and then based on what I observe, I start to intervene and start the treatment to see what works so I can send the parents home with a plan after just the second session.
POSITIVE	I establish a relationship with the parents by listening very carefully to what's stressing them because when a kid isn't eating, it is extremely stressful to families.
NEUTRAL	So figuring out exactly what's stressing them out, it tells me how quickly I can go so I'm not asking the family to do too much.
POSITIVE	I try and make the sessions -- because I'm asking the kids to do things that are very hard and can be very scary for the kid, so I try to make it as fun as possible so the kids like to come, even though I'm asking them to do challenging things.
POSITIVE	Hay my name is Amanda and I just wanted to make a quick video about payday loans online and the experience I've had personally with them and I know that some people call them same day loans or online cash loans which they are all pretty much the same thing.
NEUTRAL	And I've personally had 5 payday loans now for all sorts of different things.
POSITIVE	But the website I've used for the last 3 payday loans that I've gotten has been absolutely the best, and so I went ahead and put a link in the description box for you if you want to check it out.
POSITIVE	I just applied online, filled the form on there web page out and the money was in my account the that afternoon.
POSITIVE	A couple of weeks into paying the loan back I decided I wanted to up my payments so I could pay off my loan faster and it was no problem, the customer service was fast and easy there was no stress which is some thing that I really liked about the company.
POSITIVE	And now to get payday loans online you need to be at least 18 years old and you have to have a regular paycheck coming in but that's about it.
POSITIVE	OK so if your looking for a payday loan then this website is absolutely worth a look, I've has a stress free experience with them, and there is a link for that in the description and I'll add a link to a free credit score so you can check what your credit rating is before you apply.

NEGATIVE	As such the money is tied up for a definable period of time.

NEUTRAL	Coraline challenges her Other Mother to find the three souls of the children and her parents.
NEUTRAL	As per agreement, if Coraline finds the souls first, she and the rest of them get to return to the real world.
NEUTRAL	If her Other Mother finds them first, Coraline will stay in the Other World.
POSITIVE	Coraline finds all three souls in marbles throughout the house and find her parents in a snow globe.
NEUTRAL	In the end, after trapping her Other Mother’s hand in a well, Coraline begins to fix her relationship with her parents.
NEUTRAL	As always a lot can be said about this story, but what draws my interest and attention is the idea of dual worlds, as if everything in this world is mirrored in another world.
POSITIVE	More importantly, this book explores how roles and relationships change in those dual worlds.
NEUTRAL	Coraline must save her parents and others - a role that she is not used to undertaking.
NEUTRAL	Different social spheres act as these dual worlds where individuals must or choose to assume certain roles and responsibilities.
NEUTRAL	For example, in one world, you might be a “student” and as a “student” you undertake certain responsibilities.
POSITIVE	In another world, you might be a “son” or “daughter”. And in yet another world, you might be an “employee”. You’re the same person looking back in a reflection, yet at the same time, you’re different.

NEGATIVE	&gt;&gt; There's often been a dichotomy set up or proposed that really pits morals against researchers in saying that in proposing that human embryonic stem cell creation is tantamount to murder as it involves the destruction of the blastocyst.
NEGATIVE	It's not going to be used to create life; it's destined to be destroyed.
POSITIVE	One of the attributes about the LSE program that I think makes it stand out more than anything else is its strong focus on leadership and not leadership in this kind of traditiona,l kind of top-down "I'm gonna show you how to fix the problems", but leadership in a more engaged and empowering sort of way.
POSITIVE	Really focuses on getting people around the table to to solve problems together rather than kinda following directions, so I think that that's one of the things that makes it unique and makes it one of those things that I think the graduates from the LSE program are gonna do some pretty amazing things.
POSITIVE	Once body, breath, senses mind, reason and ego are all integrated in the object of contemplation, the universal spirit". So that's what we're going for.
POSITIVE	The gig economy is freelancers and people working for themselves
POSITIVE	 It gives us the opportunity to do some of the things that we really want to do instead of working a full time job
NEUTRAL	 It took me a long time to find stability with benefits within the life coach industry
POSITIVE	 Having a flexible job and doing something that I'm really good at is more important than being in a nine-to-five
POSITIVE	 The gig economy can empower the worker because you have more flexibility over creating a career
NEUTRAL	 I think that there are a lot of benefits out there that a lot of people don't know about
NEUTRAL	 You know, like Small Business Administration within each state
NEUTRAL	 If you believe in a lot of the things that unions supported, we don't have that kind of dynamic in the economy
POSITIVE	 I think we're going to start seeing benefits packages pop up for the gig economy because so many people are missing out now on the tax front, on the healthcare front, on the retirement front
POSITIVE	 I think it's good for the society
POSITIVE	 I think it gives people, especially people who aren't traditionally trained and low income, are able to kind of start up and do their own thing and seeing that others are doing that is helpful
POSITIVE	 So entrpreneurship kind of goes hand in hand
NEUTRAL	 People go from project to project or day job to day job rather than having a job
POSITIVE	 This idea of having trends and services on demand has allowed us to operate more freely and almost have this concierge type service
NEUTRAL	 It's a trend that's not going to be reversed
NEUTRAL	 It's not as big a faux pas to have a resume where you have multiple situations going on
POSITIVE	 I don't think millennials really want to work eight hours a day
POSITIVE	 I know I'm a little older than a millennial and I don't so
POSITIVE	 This new frame of working where people provide services that they could do pretty easily to other people looking for them in a marketplace or technology enabled format
NEUTRAL	 I would pick flexibility over a stable job with benefits because I like the idea that I can work when I need to and work really hard if I need more money and I'm my own boss
POSITIVE	 For me my work was never just a way to make a living
POSITIVE	 I wanted it to be an expression of a passion
NEUTRAL	become, there will be water wars and in fact my institute at ASU

NEUTRAL	Many auditions will ask simply for a one minute audition, a one minute monologue.
NEGATIVE	If you have a one minute monologue and you go one ten or one fifteen, most likely you'll be disqualified from getting the part, and a director may well say, stop and leave the stage.
NEUTRAL	The last thing that we want to take a look at when we're talking about evaluating a speech and speaker with regards to presentation is overall poise and confidence.
NEGATIVE	Are they not giving any negative criticisms about themselves?
POSITIVE	They do it as professionally as they can and they sit down.
NEGATIVE	Are they very tentative and unsure and hiding behind the podium and personifying lack of self-esteem, lack of confidence?
NEGATIVE	Get ready for this to be bad." That's not good, that's not what you want to do.
NEUTRAL	If they fill, if they said they have selected someone that skills are a better fit, stop back and reflect on a scale of one to a hundred, what was your skill set.

POSITIVE	Hi, this is Michael Niren, Immigration Lawyer and Founder of VisaPlace.com.
NEGATIVE	Well, the government makes it even more difficult because they're accepting 500 applicants and will only choose 60 within a very short time frame.
NEGATIVE	I feel that it's unlikely that anybody will qualify for this.
NEGATIVE	If Canada wants to attract investment and investors, this is definitely not the way to do it.
NEGATIVE	This threshold, it's just completely on a different planet in my opinion.
NEGATIVE	I can say, unfortunately, I don't think it's a serious program.
NEUTRAL	First of all, you need an enormous $10 million net worth to qualify.

NEUTRAL	Beef and milk and cream and butter and leather and on and on and on
NEUTRAL	Think about the pig brought over by Columbus

POSITIVE	You want to act like you're talking to your friend, just chatting to your mom or dad or somebody that you've known for years.

NEUTRAL	If I look at our work, obviously, you need skills, fundamental skills, to understand if it's a go to market kind of work, then you need to understand how markets work.
POSITIVE	But the core of the work that we do is about problem solving.
NEUTRAL	So, sometimes if you do not have that and you're coming from a background has not kind of built those skills, you might have a problem because a lot of our cases might require modeling.
NEUTRAL	They might require a kind of complex mathematical kind of analysis.
NEUTRAL	And if you're not comfortable with numbers and spreadsheets then you can have a big problem.
NEUTRAL	Often engineers or others who have gone through courses which build those skills find it an advantage.
POSITIVE	And having an engineering background or going through an engineering degree has its pros and cons.
NEUTRAL	On one hand, they do allow you to think about how to break down a problem and look at different competence and come to kind of a design solution.On the other hand, they can potentially straight jacket you in problem solving which means in some sense they force you to move very quickly into a solution without really exploring a lot of different options or develop divergent thinking.I am a very firm believer that before you converge into a solution, you really need to explore different solutions.
NEUTRAL	Keep on pushing the boundary of thinking.
POSITIVE	An engineering mindset is always to get to closure, get to the solution and then move on to execution.
NEUTRAL	And doing that very quickly can be a challenge because you probably do not explore all the solution options.
NEUTRAL	And sometimes you may end up missing out on a truly innovative solution if you do that, if you close out a problem very quickly.
NEUTRAL	But, as I said, it does give you a good handle in how do you solve problems, how do you think about a problem?
NEGATIVE	Secondly, in a lot of the work, having mathematical skills and thinking is very critical.
POSITIVE	I'm a Distinguished Professor of Economics and Health Policy.
POSITIVE	And I show how those movements can predict what is happening to the rest of the economy.
POSITIVE	the creative process and finding new markets for the products that we create
NEUTRAL	Are you signed up for my mailing list
POSITIVE	If so, you get free weekly emails in your inbox with English videos and lessons, as well stories of American culture and my own life
POSITIVE	We’ll pick it up from here in the next video in this series
POSITIVE	In the next video, we’ll go over three more common interview questions: ‘How did you hear about this position’, ‘what attracted you to our company
POSITIVE	’ I hope this video on job interviews has been helpful
POSITIVE	There’s nothing better than walking out of an interview feeling that you were fully prepared
POSITIVE	If you have interview-related questions or stories, please post them in the comments below
POSITIVE	My name is Louise and I'm at the Linus Pauling Mock Congress at LBCC this year and my bill is about mental health and mental illnesses in children and teens.
POSITIVE	And my bill is to help get support and care for children suffering from mental illnesses.
NEGATIVE	Because 50% of girls and 40% of guys have some form of mental disease.
POSITIVE	And the bill is to get health care facilities, hospitals, clinics to provide free or reduced priced treatment for children even if they walk in without a guardian or parent.
NEUTRAL	MS. JENSEN: Our next question comes from Korka Bah: "During the AU summit in Addis, Ethiopian prime minister called for urgent action to avoid the further escalating of violence between Christians and Muslims in Central African Republic.
POSITIVE	I encouraged her to move forward in preparing for elections to take place no later than February of 2015. We have provided more than $100 million in support to the peacekeeping effort.
POSITIVE	We have in addition provided this year alone $45 million in humanitarian support and we will continue to support efforts until an ultimate solution is found for the situation in CAR.
POSITIVE	We particularly thank the French Government for their efforts and the troops that they have put on the ground.
POSITIVE	And we're particularly grateful for the African troops that have been provided by the neighboring countries to help bring a level of security back to CAR.
NEUTRAL	But ultimately, the security situation can only be addressed by the people of CAR themselves.
NEUTRAL	And I use this opportunity to call upon the people of CAR to end the violence, to find a way forward to peace.
POSITIVE	Hi, it's good that you can join me in my study
NEUTRAL	 This week, in addition to working on the doctrine of the atonement, I've been preparing for my upcoming debate with Eric Wielenberg on the foundations of morality
NEUTRAL	 Moreover, this kind of a "same to you" response on Wielenberg's part is apt to provide aid and comfort to the other opponents of which, against which, he's arguing; namely, his fellow atheists who deny the objectivity of moral values and duties
NEUTRAL	 Wielenberg is engaged in a two-front war
NEUTRAL	 On the one hand he's battling against theists who affirm the objectivity of moral values and duties, but ground them in God
NEUTRAL	 On the other hand he's battling against his fellow atheists who deny that there are any objective moral values and duties
POSITIVE	 And by adopting this "tu quoque" strategy against the theist he seems tacitly to admit that both his view and theism are encumbered with these unresolved problems, and that's going to make his fellow secularists who deny the objectivity of moral values and duties feel very good indeed
NEUTRAL	 Wielenberg, you may remember, is a non-theist who believes in the objectivity of moral values and duties and who grounds them in a sort of moral Platonism
NEGATIVE	 In response to my criticisms of his view, Wielenberg adopts a very interesting strategy
POSITIVE	 Philosophers call this strategy "tu quoque," which is Latin for "the same to you
NEUTRAL	" On the playground it would be, "so's your old man!" In other words, you don't answer the objection, you just throw it back in the face of your opponent and say, "the same to you
NEGATIVE	 You've got the same problem as me
NEUTRAL	 Your view is just as bad as my view
NEUTRAL	" Now the risk of this kind of a strategy is that it doesn't really answer the problem with your view
POSITIVE	 It just says that the other guy's view is as bad as yours and if your opponent can show that his view is not really analogous to your view, then you're stuck with this unresolved problem
NEGATIVE	In the March 19th election, we will not be selecting a new government
POSITIVE	 The government of Canada will be fixed
POSITIVE	 So we need a voice that can bring people together, that can galvanize people, that can even attract some of the Conservatives in order to get anything past the Harper government until we have a general election again in 2015
NEUTRAL	 Is that voice going to be another Liberal or another NDP person who will be sitting silently in the backbenches and given an order paper every day? Or is it going to be somebody who brings forward a clear vision and is given the voice to speak as loud and strong as possible for this community
NEUTRAL	 So that this community has a voice in Parliament
NEUTRAL	 I’m Elizabeth May’s Climate Change Critic
POSITIVE	 I’ve worked with her for three years on Shadow Cabinet and several years before that
POSITIVE	 I’m a trusted confidante and I belong to a party that wants a bigger voice in Parliament that demands a bigger voice in Parliament And, it’s a party that respects the fact that individual members should have a voice and should always vote their conscience
NEUTRAL	 It is there already, and it’s not going to change
NEUTRAL	 The differences in the numbers of the parties mean that there will be no dramatic shift in power
NEUTRAL	 Now the Liberals and the NDP will tell you that it is critical that they get another member
NEUTRAL	 But the question really here is we’re only electing one member
NEUTRAL	 We’re only sending one person to Parliament
NEUTRAL	 So the question really is what is the best voice that we can send to Parliament that will most contribute to the dialogue
NEUTRAL	 The opposition parties still have to work together to get anything past Parliament
NEUTRAL	 And they even have to pull some of the Conservatives
NEUTRAL	For more information on variable annuities and the risks that are associated with them, go on the web to www.sec.gov, click on enforcement, then click on investor alerts, and you'll see variable annuities, what you should know, and it's a tutorial about variable annuities and some of the risk associated therein.
NEGATIVE	The other problem is, variable annuities are comprised of mutual funds.
NEUTRAL	Typically mutual fund managers also have expenses to manage your money.
NEGATIVE	Satan has fooled many Christians into thinking they don’t have to be separate to follow Jesus.
POSITIVE	As GOD has said: ‘I will dwell in them and walk among them.
NEGATIVE	If they are a Christian who is going to church or religious but are NOT following Jesus in righteousness, if they are sinning then you NEED to BREAK yourself off from them to follow Jesus in righteousness.
NEGATIVE	DO WHATEVER IT TAKES to be severed from the world, because without being severed from the world there is NO WAY you can be righteous in the eyes of Jesus.
NEUTRAL	They don’t think that they have to come out and be separate to follow Jesus, BUT SATAN knows that if he gets you to fellowship with sinners, to take part in what they are doing then you won’t really have your eyes on Jesus, you won’t really follow Jesus with your heart, but you will just pay Jesus lip-service, but He will NOT have your heart.
NEGATIVE	So many Christians are paying the LORD lip-service but they have NOT separated themselves from this world.
NEUTRAL	of democratic systems of government which haven't had any of those side benefits
POSITIVE	In Afghanistan for example, we haven't had just one election or two elections, we've gone through three elections, presidential and parliamentary and what do we find
NEGATIVE	Do we find a flourishing civil society, a vigorous rule of law and good security
NEGATIVE	In Pakistan, in lots of sub-saharan Africa, again you can see, democracy and elections are compatible with corrupt governments with states that are unstable and dangerous
POSITIVE	In the marketing puzzle you’re gonna have to include a large on line piece into that puzzle.
NEUTRAL	It can’t just be something on the sidelines that you’re doing also because everybody else tells you you have to do.
NEUTRAL	Hi this is Diana Barchenger and I came to Dr. Polzin to help me take care of the pains that I had in my feet.
NEGATIVE	They would really get warm at night, when I had covers on my feet; I had sharp, shooting pains going through my feet and they are getting better to stand on, because before they would really hurt and every step in every area of my foot would hurt.
POSITIVE	I encourage everybody to come in and give him a try, thanks.
NEGATIVE	The United States and the Department of State strongly recommends against all travel by U.S.
NEGATIVE	And now that Mr. Warmbier has gone through this criminal process, we would urge the DPRK to pardon him and grant him special amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds.
NEGATIVE	Mr. Warmbier was reportedly charged with, quote, “hostile acts against the DPRK,” end quote, and sentenced to 15 years’ hard labor.
NEGATIVE	The Department believes that the sentence is unduly harsh for the actions Mr. Warmbier allegedly took.
NEGATIVE	citizens arrested in the DPRK are not used for political purposes, it’s increasingly clear from its very public treatment of these cases that the DPRK does exactly that.
NEGATIVE	It only underscores the risks associated with travel to North Korea.
NEGATIVE	The Department of State strongly recommends against all travel by U.S.
NEUTRAL	We need to inject energy into the economy, generate tomorrow's jobs, and make public money work harder.
NEUTRAL	Or, how can I be sure my contract is safe and fair – even if I don't have a law degree?
NEGATIVE	This uncertainty makes it harder to trust the cloud, and harder to unlock its benefits.
POSITIVE	And we'll help successful industry-led certification schemes work across borders in the EU: so you can find out which cloud providers you can trust.
POSITIVE	Meanwhile, the European cloud partnership we are setting up will help us work together to find the best cloud solutions for the public sector.
NEUTRAL	And stimulate a growing and maturing market: benefiting every cloud user, public or private.
NEUTRAL	I don't want national rules constraining the cloud to tiny markets: only if we “think European” can we get the right economies of scale.
POSITIVE	The EU's single market is our crown jewel: and the cloud is a great digital home for it.
POSITIVE	If we "think European", everyone – businesses, consumers, governments – can travel, trade or transact online easily across borders, without the hassle of 27 different sets of rules.
POSITIVE	Embracing the cloud is good for business, good for public services, and good for our economy.
NEUTRAL	Offering cheaper, more flexible IT to boost businesses' bottom line.
NEUTRAL	And enabling public services that are more integrated and effective, while saving taxpayers' money.
POSITIVE	All together, the benefits from more and better use of cloud computing could be worth several hundred euros a year for every European.
NEUTRAL	Already today, many people use a number of cloud services without even realising it – from webmail to Facebook.
NEUTRAL	Hello! I’m Kurt Browning, Pasco County Superintendent of Schools with an update on Hurricane Irma
NEUTRAL	 We all know that hurricane paths can change from one update to the next
NEUTRAL	 Principals whose schools are used as shelters have to prepare for evacuees and staff the shelter as long as people are still there
NEGATIVE	 We also want to allow our employees time to prepare their homes and property for the impact of the storm
NEGATIVE	 The governor has closed all state offices on Friday, as well
NEUTRAL	 All sports and extracurricular activities are canceled for Friday and over the weekend
NEUTRAL	 There’s a good chance that schools will be closed on Monday, but no decision has been made in that regard
NEUTRAL	 We will contact everyone on Sunday by phone and email, and will post information on the district and school websites and on district social media sites
NEUTRAL	 We also will notify media as decisions are made
POSITIVE	 Please continue to make preparations
NEUTRAL	 Secure your homes, stock up on flashlight batteries, water and non-perishable foods
NEUTRAL	 Based on what we know now, and after consultation with Pasco County emergency operations leaders, we will need to open shelters in schools beginning Friday morning
NEUTRAL	 Everyone be safe! We will continue to post updates online, and will be in touch regarding the status of schools next week
NEGATIVE	 That means we will have to close all schools on Friday
NEUTRAL	 Although you may question why we are closing all schools, there are good reasons
NEUTRAL	 First, the EOC doesn’t want school buses full of school children on the roads as evacuees from other parts of the state are arriving here
NEGATIVE	 We expect thousands of south and east coast Floridians to seek shelter here, or to pass through on their way further north
POSITIVE	 We also use school buses to help evacuate special needs citizens to shelters
NEUTRAL	 Our food and nutrition services staff work in the shelters providing meals to evacuees
NEUTRAL	 Likewise, our maintenance and other employees staff the shelters
NEUTRAL	 So, today I was supposed to film an episode of Ask an Autistic, and it was going pretty well
NEUTRAL	 I drink a lot of carbonated water
NEUTRAL	 And you can see my cat calendar over there
POSITIVE	 It's all black cats
NEUTRAL	 One for every month of the year
NEUTRAL	 Something I've wanted to address in the a/Autistic community is the "throwing under the bus" of intellectually and cognitively disabled people
NEUTRAL	 Now, I know what you're thinking
NEUTRAL	 "Amythest, no one's intending to hurt anybody else's feelings
NEUTRAL	 I was battling executive dysfunction, which kind of explains what bad thing happened
NEUTRAL	" And I'm like, I know
NEGATIVE	 But lateral violence in the disability community happens
NEUTRAL	 And so here's what I see happening a lot
NEUTRAL	 There is autistic people, and they are talking about Autism and their neurotype, and they go to defend themselves by saying things like, "Well, autistic people aren't stupid"
NEGATIVE	 Or, they even use the r word
NEUTRAL	 Or, "Autistic people are actually really smart
NEUTRAL	" And in defense of non-speaking autistic people, it's like, "Well you know, just because they look outwardly unintelligent doesn't mean that's true
NEUTRAL	 They could have a really high IQ"
NEGATIVE	 Which, by the way, IQ is totally not a thing
NEGATIVE	 It's super racist and ableist in its origins, and it's just terrible, and not even that accurate
NEUTRAL	 But it was going okay and I did my makeup and I was like, alright, let's do this, I got my notes
NEGATIVE	 And super biased, towards white men
NEUTRAL	 So, if you want to read about that, you know, video description
NEUTRAL	 They're like, "Oh, they have a high IQ, they are actually really intelligent, so that's why they deserve respect"
NEGATIVE	 But the thing is that intelligence [scoffs] is this super racist, ableist, sexist concept
NEUTRAL	 And yet, it's like, how a/Autistic people defend ourselves
NEUTRAL	 And in the process we hurt our intellectually disabled and cognitively disabled disabled cousins
NEUTRAL	 And the thing is, there are a/Autistic people with intellectual disabilities as well
NEGATIVE	 And there is this valuing of traditional abled ideals of intelligence that is hurting the community
NEUTRAL	 And then I was like three minutes in and the battery died
POSITIVE	 When it all comes down to it, human beings deserve respect, and autonomy, and inclusion, and accommodation because they are human beings
NEUTRAL	 Not because they're smart in the ways that our society perceives as being the most important or valid
POSITIVE	 All ways of being are valid
POSITIVE	 Intellectually disabled people are awesome
NEGATIVE	 The concept of intelligence, and giving people value based on their intelligence, is super not-awesome
NEUTRAL	 So all together, I think we as the a/Autistic community can do better for intellectually and cognitively disabled cousins and fellow a/Autistics
POSITIVE	 This has been my first ever blog, I hope it went okay, here's Kitty
NEUTRAL	 And now it's charging, but I won't be able to film an episode today, so I wanted to make use of my makeup and my words that I have and make a little vlog
NEUTRAL	 I don't know how to vlog
NEUTRAL	 I've never done this before
NEUTRAL	 Um, I'm in my kitchen
NEUTRAL	 You can see all my carbonated water over there
POSITIVE	But I can bridge the gap of language because I've instructed for over a decade.
POSITIVE	If you're ready to strengthen your skills, while learning more about yourself and the world around you, I'm excited to chat with you today.
